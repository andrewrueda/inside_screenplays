             OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE

             Behind logos and title cards we hear the eerie and edgy beginning

             of Aerosmith's 'Sweet Emotion''. The titles are offset by random

             high school yearbook photos of members of the case. Some are

             their official school pictures with their activity listings,

             while others are the students in various extracurricular activity

             poses. The last title reads:

                         LAST DAY OF SCHOOL   MAY 28, 1976   12:55 p.m.

             SERIES OF SHOTS

             As the song kicks in we SEE many of these same characters in

             their lunch-time environment.

        EXT:   HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

        The convertible parks next to a crowded, smoke-fiiled car with

        the windows rolled up. KEITH PICKFORD and MICHELLE BURROUGHS

        soon hop out of this car and head toward the school. Standing

        next to his truck, RANDY 'PINK' FLOYD calls out to them.

                               PINK

                   Pickfordi    You stoner!

        Pickford acknowledges him with a slightly sarcastic, mimicking

        voice as he and Michelle walk over to him.

                            PICKFORD

                  They say it'll kill ya but they

                  don't say when...

                             PINK

                   How's it lookin' for tonight?

                             PICKFORD

                   Three kegs...

                             PINK

                  Cool. But the big news is... Check

jjptV             this shit- out.

        Pink grabs a tarp in the bed of his truck and with one quick

        motion, jerks away the canvas and reveals a smiling Ronald

        McDonald statue. Formerly of the drive-thru line, Ronald has a

        speaker in his stomach.

                             PICKFORD

                   Awwrighc...

                               MICHELLE

                   Cool.

                             PINK

                   Me and Dollar nabbed it about four-

                   thirty this morning. We just went

                   through there for lunch... They got

                   this old lady standing out there

                   taking orders by hand.

        He imitates a little old lady scribbling on a note pad.

                             PINK

                        (continuing)

                   Did you want fries with that? The

                   thing's three feet away from her.

        They laugh a bit and walk together up the stairs to the school.



         INT: HALLWAY - DAY

         Pickford, Michelle, and Pink walk down the hall.

                            PICKFORD

                  Can't believe we gotta be here ac

                  all today...

                            MICHELLE

                  Let the torture begin...

         They pass PAUL SLATER near a water fountain.

                            PICKFORD

                  Slater, son...

                            PINK

                  How's it going?

                            SLATER

                  It's fixin' to be going A LOT

                  better...

         Slater pops something in his mouth and takes a quick gulp at the

         fountain. He then offers up his hand and Pickford "gives him

         five* in the slowest, coolest way possible.

                            SLATER

                  So what time tonight?

                             PICKFORD

                   'Bout nine or ten...

                            SLATER

                  All right.

         Slater walks away while Pickford, Michelle, and Pink walk near

         Pink's classroom door.

                              PINK

                  Later...

                            PICKFORD

                  See you up there after...

         As Pickford walks away, he acknowledges TONY OLSON and MIKE

         NEWHOUSE standing in the hall near the door to Pink's classroom.

                            PICKFORD

                  If it isn't Woodward and Bernstein.

         Tony and Mike just smirk at Pickford as Pink slows down near the

         door.

y#**Y,

                              PINK

                  Men.

                           MIKE

                 So was this a smoked or liquid

                 lunch?

        Pink points at him like "yeah right" as a friend and'classmate of

        theirs, ROYCE CRAWFORD, pokes his head out of the door.

                           ROYCE

                 Poker game still on for tonight?

                           PINK

                 I don't know about tonight for

                 me.. .

                              MIKE

,                    I thought we should all go out.

                           TONY

                 And do what?

                           PINK

                 I'm probably going to Pickford's

                 party.

                           MIKE

                 Exactly - we should do something

                 like that. We can play poker any

                 time.

                           ROYCE

                 I don't know, sounds suspect,

                 we'll have to put it up before the

                 committee.

        Royce and Pink head into the room while Tony suddenly remembers

        something he wants to tell Mike and gestures for him to walk with

        him down the hall a bit.

                           TONY

                 Okay, I had this dream last

                 night...

                      (grins quizzically)

                 Okay, you have to promise not to

                 tell ANYONE.

                              MIKE

                 Sure.

                           TONY

                 Say I promise.

                               MIKE

                          (reciting)

                     'I promise not to tell anyone...'

        2   CONTINUED:   (2)

            Tony gets a little quieter and makes sure no one is listening.

                                TONY

                      Okay... In this dream I was having

                      sex with what had a perfect female

                      body but...

                                  MIKE

                      But what?    What?

            Tony changes his mind.

                                TONY

                      I can't say...

                                MIKE

                      Oh come on, you can't give a build-

                      up like that and then not deliver.

                      Okay, so, a beautiful female body,

                      we're off to a good start...

            He gestures for Tony to continue.

                                TONY

    ^                 But the head of... •Abraham Lincoln.

            MIKE doesn't really react at all.

    hold on for just a moment. In the back of the class, Slater and

    two others, STONER #1 and STONER #2, discuss the more technical

    aspects of rock and roll. On Slater's desk is a three foot bong

    he has made as his final woodworking project.

            spanking with his newly sanded board. The teacher of the class,

            a middle-aged bald man named MR. RIX, is laid back in his chair

            fast asleep with his mouth open. On his way out the door, Benny

                       I was just kind of worried about

                       him. Sounded like everyone wanted

                       to kill him.

              Jodi walks back to the others while the guys turn and continue

              on. As soon as Jodi is. far enough away not to hear them, Don

              looks up at Benny with a kind of mischievous grin on his face.

             As they drive along, Pink tries to explain the Vietnam situation

             to Benny without being too condescending.

                                 PINK

                       ...Well maybe because our country

                       had something to do with fucking up

                       where they lxved and the least we

                      Benny positions a speaker on top of Pink's truck and hits a

                      switch on his CB. He reaches for the mic.

                      assumes a confrontational pose facing a wall of classrooms that

                      are all glass windows, many of which are open.

                               up! Any of you ever heard of Fred

                               O'Bannion? He was the meanest

                               senior last year. I would've been

                               the meanest senior this year except

                               O'Bannion just found out he's going

                               to be a senior again this next

                               year. He flunked out and he's

                               really pissed off about it! I feel

                               sorry for you guys. And because we

                               feel sorry for you, we're going to

                               take it easy on you. If you wait

                               for us after school today, you'll

                               only get one lick from each of us.

              The boys look up as if wanting to hear more. They don't.

        12   EXT:   HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - CAY

             Pink's truck pulls up near the practice field. Several coaches

             are milling about when they notice a few of their prize specimens

             have arrived. COACH CLEMENTS, an older and rather stoic man 's

             flanked by COACH ALPERT, who's younger, bigger, more aggressive

             and piayful. He approaches the guys as they get out of the

             truck.

                                 COACH ALPERT

                       Any of you ladies gonna be ready to

                       play some football this coming

                       fall?

                                 BENNY

                       I've been doing so good in my

                       English classes, coach, I think I'm

                       going to take next fall off and

                       become a writer.

             They all laugh.

                                 COACH ALPERT

                       Boy, you couldn't write your name

                       if it wasn't stenciled on your

                       locker.

                                 (to all -of them)

\                      Now don't go getting soft on me

    i                  this summer... Sitting by a pool

                       somewhere, chasing the muff

                       around...

             They all laugh a little as they start walking back to the school.

                                 COACH ALPERT

                       Break down!

             Benny automatically falls into a stance where his knees are bent,

             his fists are clenched and held firmly up near his face, almost

             karate-like. Don only slightly goes through such ridiculous

             motions and Pink not at all.

                                 COACH ALPERT

                       Hell, my grandmother's quicker and

                       tougher than you panty-waiscs...

                       Course she is 6'3', 250 and runs a

                       4.5 forty.

             Noticing Pink's poor attitude, Coach Clements suddenly rouses a

             little and points at him.

                                 COACH CLEMENTS

                       Randy Floyd, before next fall,

                       you're in need of a serious



r                      attitude adjustment young man.

             12   CONTINUED:

                  Don and Benny glance back at the coach and then at Pink, who

                  keeps walking but doesn't say anything back.

                                     COACH CLEMENTS

                           Better get your priorities straight

                           and watch out with that other crowd

                           you're running with. Don't think

                           we haven't noticed.

                  As soon as they are all at a safe distance and walking tcward -he

                  school, the guys start to ride Pink a little.

                           Forget you guys.

                  As they continue to walk, HUDSON HIGGINS drives up near them.

                  FRED O'BANNION is sitting in the passenger side of the car.

             13   INT. HALLWAY - DAY

                  Don and Pink walk down the hall in no particular hurry. In his

 I                usual cocky way, Don looks into various classrooms along the way,

 !,               acknowledging those he deems worthy of recognition. As an

                  UNDERCLASSMAN walks by. looking a bit afraid of Don to begin

                  with, Don acts like he's going to hit him. The Underclassman

                  reacts by covering himself up and bracing for the blow. Don

                  pulls his punch, of course, and leaves the Underclassman to walk

                  off totally humiliated. He and Pink keep walking like nothing

                  happened. Soon they are at the door to Pink's class.

                                     PINK

                  He looks in and sees the very cute and sensual LETICIA GARCIA

 ,                sitting near the door.

                                        DON

'                  She smiles but shakes her head "no." He sticks his tongue out at

                  her very suggestively. The teacher, MS. STROUD, suddenly looks

I                 out the door and begins to close it.

                           Ginny, I been meaning to ask you

                           out. What are you doing this

                           weekend? It'll be legal...

                           school's out.

                  She rolls her eyes a bit as he walks off smiling and then closes

                  the door. Don continues down the hall but, without an audience,

                  seems a little lonely. Suddenly, MR. IRVINE walks around a

                  corner and looks straight at him.

                                     MR. IRVINE

                           Don, either get in a classroom or

                           come to my office, right now!

                           I was running an errand.

                  He quickly ducks into a classroom.

                  Don walks into the class and soon acknowledges Pickford,

                     He then walks up to the teacher, MRS. SNELGROVE, an old lady on

                     the verge of retirement. She's reading a romance novel and

                     doesn't even know he's there until he speaks up.

                     Possibly not even sure if Don is in her class or not, she gets up

                     and walks to the door. Seeing nobody, she walks a little out

                     into the hall. At this, Don suddenly shuts the door behind her

J                    and locks it. As she knocks on the door, he heads to the back of

                     the room and opens a window.

                     Inside the classroom, the students are anxiously waiting for

                     school to let out. Pink subtly heads to the back of the room,

                     opens the window, and calks to Don. In the front of the class,

                     Ms. Stroud is sitting and talking informally with a few of the

                     more interested students.

                 before everyone gets going, Mrs. Stroud signals for them to

                 listen up to one last thing.

                           celebrating is the fact that a

                           bunch of slave-owning, aristocratic

                           white males didn't want to pay

                 are trashing it with extra paper and random contents from their

                      In contrast, the senior girls seem much more organized and

                      orderly as they load up three trucks with nervous and giggling

                      freshman girls.. Before getting in, the seniors put pacifiers in

                           So what's going on over here,

                           social hour? I'm supposed to be

                           being a bitch right now.

                           Back to the pit, kid.

J                 Sabrina glances back at Tony as she's being marched away. Tony

i*                kind of waves bye to her and she sort of waves back in a shy but

                 'slightly teasing manner.

                           clean all that shit off her.

                           seniors. They'll now be all kinds

                           of younger girls who think we're

                           cool just by virtue of our age and

                           senior status.

                           I guess it's some sort of a

                           compensation for all these tortuous

                           years of neglect. You have to

                           admit, despite our accomplishments

                           in other areas, we don't have a

                           whole lot to show for ourselves in

                           the female category.

                 Mike sees an opportunity to build his case for them going out

                 later that night.

                                  here.

                          There's someone here that says he

                          needs to talk to you.

                          What about? Who is it?

                He finishes putting everything away and even gives a little quick

                spray of some air freshener. Then there's a loud knock at the

                door and his father's voice rings out.

                                     PICKFORD'S DAD (O.S.)

                          Keith!   Open the door.

                Pickford pulls out the ice pick lock and opens the door. At the

                last minute Pink remembers he has a bag of pot in his hand and

                stuffs it down the front of his pants.

                                    PICKFORD

                          Who's out there?

                PICKFORD'S DAD, a rather large man semi-fashionably dressed in a

                leisure suit type outfit, steps into the room.

                                    PICKFORD'S DAD

                          Did you order some kegs of beer?

                Suppressing a panic, Pickford walks over to his window and looks

   |            out.

               Outside, Pickford walks right up to him. Oblivious to the

               situation, the delivery guy pulls out some paperwork.

                                    DELIVERY GUY

                          Are you the right Mr. Pickford?

                Pickford is so angry he is practically chewing his teeth.

                          Aren't you a little early?

                 The delivery guy looks at the paperwork.

                                     DELIVERY GUY

                           Oh, hour and a half early. I'm

                           trying to get off early today so I

                           thought I'd swing by and see if

                           anyone was here.

                 Pickford glances around and notices his parents are now watching

                 their interaction.

                                    PICKFORD

                          ...So, I guess you got the wrong

                          house...

                 The Delivery guy finally catches on when Pickford motions with

                 his eyes to his parents.

                                     DELIVERY GUY

                           altogether...

                 He starts loading the kegs back up and Pickford walks up the

                 driveway.

                                    PICKFORD'S DAD

                          tonight, son?

                                   PICKFORD

                          No. I don't know WHAT that was all

                          about.

                              here?

                 His father looks at both of the young men for an extended moment

                 and then over at the kegs being loaded up. He looks back at them

                 and then makes a decision, shaking his head.

                    B) The lights going on at the baseball fields where games are

         "**        being played. Mitch is pitching in his game.

 I                  impossible tight jeans.

                    and red of an unspecified design. Pink takes off.

    a               a phone call and Royce straightens up portraits of Washington,

                    Lincoln, and Kennedy that hang on Tony's living room wall.

                   Mitch throws strike three to end the game. Amidst the hoopla, he

                   just stands there not knowing where to go. Eventually he gets :r.

                   the line where the two teams walk down a row telling each other

                    "good game" but glances over at the group of seniors who are now

                   shadowing him. After his last "good game, " in which one of the

                   'guys on the other team says "good luck," he picks up his stuff

                   near the dugout, barely looks around, and then slowly walks

                   toward the center field gate. The seniors quickly head that way.

ijffSv             Later, past the centerfield*fence, the seniors are like a group

                   of wild animals feeding. They cake turns giving Mitch licks as

                   he leans against a car. When they are through, they get in their

                   completely red and watery.

                     got nabbed and they made him pay

                     for it.

          Royce and Mike kind of look at Tony like they're wondering which

          side he's on.

                     Not that I minded him paying for

          He gets up from the table and walks to the bathroom.



     44   EXT:    MITCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Reving up in front of Mitch's house is a jacked-up Nova driven by

          BOBBY WOODERSON. Slater sits in the passenger seat and Pink is

          in the back seat. The car honks a few times impatiently before

          Mitch appears and heads toward the car.



     45   INT    WOODERSON'S CAR - NIGHT

          Mitch hops in the back seat of the car and they get going.

          Already seemingly stoned, Slater turns to Mitch.

                     Say man, you got a joint?

          Mitch looks over at Pink and then back at Slater.

                         I KNOW he's got some weed.

               Mitch looks a bit in awe of the whole setting as they walk up to

               the door.

                                   MITCH

     ^    47   INT:   EMPORIUM - NIGHT

               They walk in the Emporium at the apex of the night's activity.

               Every pool table and the all rows of foosball tables are occupied

               as Dylan's 'Hurricane* rages on the multi-speaker stereo jukebox.

               Everyone else is milling around talking or watching others play

               but continually looking around to see who's coming and going.

 i             Much of the room's focus is on the main table where ELVIS SPIVEY

,'             is playing. Wooderson heads over to Elvis' table while Pink and

 \             Mitch follow Slater over to the foosball table where Pickford is

 i .           playing and several others, including Michelle, are hanging out.

 i             Pickford slams home a "pull shot* and then looks up from the

               table with a confident, cocky attitude.

                                   PICKFORD

                         Slater, Pink, happnin'?

i                        to ask me such a question...

 i             He pops the ball back into play and almost immediately banks a

               shot in for a score.

                                    PICKFORD

                  He cockily swats the ball back and forth all over the table

         ^        between his various men and then does a goalie *toe shot' the

                          It's no big deal, really. You

                          usually don't even get high the

                          first few times.

                          I think I'll hang here for a bit.

                 Pink and Mitch head back inside. Pickford gets behind the wheel

                 but Slater suddenly remembers something.

                                    SLATER

                          Oh hey, wait up.

                 He quickly runs back over to Wooderson's car, reaches into his

                 tape box, and pulls ouc ZZ Top's "Fandango!" As he walks back

                 across the parking lot, we hear the live introduction to the

                 first song on the album, "Thunderbird."

                 SERIES OF SHOTS

                 A) We see the 8-track tape in the deck and as we hear the words:

                friendly gesture of putting a hand on each of the boys shoulders,

                suddenly knocks their heads together. He hops back in the car

                with junior high kids who've been dancing very slow to Olivia

                Newton John's "I Honestly Love You." The song changes to Bread's

                'Make It With You* and most of the dancers simply resume their

                dancing in the same "hugging" fashion. Not. seeing their friend,

                they walk back to an adjacent room that is filled with piles of

                kids making out.

               now. We're in the big time...

        54   EXT:   BACK STREET - NIGHT

             As they turn the corner and continue walking down the street they

             notice they are being trailed in the distance by a car with its

             lights off. They say nothing but glance nervously at each othe-

             Sudderily the lights come on and the car is after them.

                                   CARL

             They take off in separate directions. The car happens to follow

             in Hirsh's direction before O'Bannion jumps out and physically

             runs him down.

                                 O'BANNION

                       Where you runnin' to boy? We ain't

                       gonna hurt you... Tell you what,

                       you just grab onto that fence and

                       start counting the stars. You

                       might be seeing some new ones up

                       there pretty quick...

  i

             He laughs sadistically. Still nervous, but resigned to his fate,

             Hirsh does as he says. He bends over a little and O'Bannion

             gives him the first big whack. At a safe distance, Carl and

             Tommy watch Hirsh get busted.

                                 CARL

                            (low voice)

             Hirsh continues to get busted in the distance.



        55   EXT: BACK STREET - NIGHT

             Riding around, Jodi, Shavonne, Kaye and Sabrina stop by where

             Hirsh is getting it.

                                 JODI

             Don comes over to the car as Jodi and Shavonne get out of the

             car.

               Adam Hirsh... caught him coming out

               of the junior high party.

     O'Bannion, finally through with Hirsh, starts toward the car. As

     Hirsh begins to walk away all the while re-adjusting his

     underwear, O'Bannion grabs a beer and tosses it to him.

                         0'BANNION

               Hey punk, have another present!

     Hirsh catches it, and keeps walking, slowly and painfully, taking

     short breaths and trying not to cry too much.

                         O'BANNION

               This fuckin' sucks! Last fuckin'

               That's the ONE thing that IS going

               on.

     Don walks over to the car, opens the trunk which is basically one

     large ice chest, and pulls out several beers. He hands a beer to

     each of the girls. He doesn't recognize Sabrina but gives her a

     flirtatious smile as he hands her a beer.

                          DON

               Hey.

     They peel out as O'Bannion almost instantaneously takes a step

     toward them and grabs his crotch.

                         O'BANNION

               Suck me! .

                          You know how for the last year or

                          so I talked about going to law

                          school so I could be an A.C.L.U.

                          lawyer or be in a position where I

 I                        after school yesterday, the sudden

                          want to do that. I mean it sounds

  i

                          good, but I really have to confront

                          the fact that I don't much like the

                          people I've been talking about

                          helping in the future. I don't

                          think I like people very much,

     60   EXT:   SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD- NIGHT

          They pass around the joint and a few beers as they ->am to ZZ Top

          Mitch takes his first puffs without much fanfare. From the

          passenger seat, Don mischievously motions Pickford to pull over.

                                 DON

                       Hey, pull up to these trash cans.

          The car slows down and pulls over next to a few trash cans that

          are sitting on the corner of somebody's front yard. Don leans

          far out the window and picks up a big metal can.

                              DON

                    Stay near this side and gun it.

          The car creeps along for a little while then peels out. At top

          speed, Don releases the trash can and it completely obliterates

          a mailbox that was in a front yard. The sheer visceral thrill of

          it all has the carload in an excited state.

                                   PICKFORD

                    Whooaah!       Man!

                                 PINK

                       Shit-yeah!

          Almost immediately, Pink rolls the back window down and leans

          out.

                                 PINK

                       Let's get one of those over there.

          The car pulls over and he grabs an old beat-up metal trash can.

                                 PINK

                       Floor that motherfucker!

          The car races off. He catches a large wooden designer-type

          mailbox dead-on. They whoop it up even more.

•i                                 DON

                    out.

                           Yeah, lose it. It doesn't fit

                           anyone's hand, anyway.

                 Mitch grabs the ball and apprehensively leans out the window.

                                     MITCH

                           Okay.

                  Pickford floors the accelerator and the car is flying. Not

                  really aiming at anything, Mitch tosses the ball into the air.

                  In a slow motion shot, the ball crashes through the windshield of

                 a car parked on the street. The guys seem more shocked than

1

                  thrilled at first - perhaps at the sheer extent of the property

                 'damage.

                 Mitch looks back at the broken windshield with a mixture of fear

                 and shame. The others start enjoying it when it becomes apparent

                  they've gotten away.

                           to that damn windshield.

                                CYNTHIA

                      I've always wanted to steal some,

                      I just have never been a big beer

                      drinker. I don't know, it's the

                      taste - call me weird.

                      Weird.

                                MIKE

                      Well, the true Dionysian way would

                      be to steal the beer and spend the

A0£?\                 rest of the evening drinking it.

                      I think that's what everyone in

                      this car needs... some good 'ol

                      worthwhile visceral experience.

           refrigerator and on the way toward the register grabs a stick of

           beef jerky. He approaches the CLERK like he's done this a

                         father?

                                   STACY

                         How embarrassing... I would DIE if

i                        my father ever did something like

                         that.

                         At least she's not here I don't

                         think. Jee-zus.

                Mitch walks over to the front door and glances out. He looks

 •              back at O'Bannion one more time and then steps outside the door.

                He waves his arms to the guys across the street and then quickly

                steps back inside. Mitch then walks over to Julie and Stacy and

 •              slowly escorts them closer to O'Bannion's table. On the way

                over, he whispers something in Julie's ear.

                                    JULIE

                               (loudly)

                         back?

                friend standing near him.

                      He positions himself behind and to the side of Carl and gets

                      ready to give him his first lick.

                      Just as he's drawing back his board, at the height of his

                      sadistic glee, O'Bannion catches a solid drop of paint on his

                      arm. He holds his swing in mid-arc, dumbfounded. As he stares

                      at the drop, he gets another drop on the head. Confused but

                      curious, he looks upward just in time to see the source of his

                      stunning and thorough drenching in white paint and other junk

                      from above. In the confusion and O'Bannion's general

                      helplessness, Carl sprints to Pentico*s waiting car that has

                      pulled up. He jumps in and they peel out.

               Physically humiliated and embarrassed, he walks over to his car.

i              On the way, he suddenly smashes his board against the street,

               cracking it into many pieces. He throws the piece that is left

               in his hand as far as he can and leaves the rest on the ground.

               He gets in his car and speeds off. Only then do the others look

               at each other and howl with .laughter.

                    sitting on its tailgate. The "McDonald/Simmons* statue stands

                    right behind the keg. Two speakers have been placed up on the

                    truck's cab and are blaring music from a tape deck. Some clever

   /9mA—            sorts have now wired up "Ronald/Gene's* stomach speaker to the

                 her and indicates to say the word.

                 They all almost simultaneously pop their tops and practically

                 inhale their beers. One finishes slightly ahead of the others

                 and tosses his beer can to the ground. The winner. Sabrina

                 wanders into the crowd.



            76   EXT:   BEER BUST ROAD - NIGHT

                 Cynthia, Mike and Tony walk up as Mike seems to smell something.

                              Hmmm. Someone's tokin' some

                 Clint overhears Mike's observation. To show off to his immediate

                 crowd, he hands them back the joint and approaches Mike.

                         In the 20's they built it to

                         simulate the light of a full moon.

                         So it's like the people around here

                They get to a rather small platform at the top. The view on one

                side is the city and on the other the country. They stare out at

                the city and back down at the others below.

/$$&\                  setting in that I can tell is going

                       of my life. I have the conscious

                       ability to rebel against that. If

          85   EXT:   OTHER SIDE OF KEG - NIGHT

               Mike stands at a distance observing the car Susan is in as the

               door opens and Party Guy #1 gets out. Several of the guy's drunk

               friends are practically standing in line to make out with her.

               Another guy is soon kissing her and feeling her large breasts.

               Suddenly 3enny walks over to them and sort, of breaks it up.

                                   BENNY

                         I don't think you boys should be

                         taking advantage of Susan when

                         she's drunk,

                              (lower)

I                        We all did that when we were

                         younger and it wasn't very nice.

                                   PARTY GUY #1

                         Great, when it's our turn we have

                         someone like you keeping us in

                         line.

                                   BENNY

                         Hey fuck you, man. Seriously, you

                         guys get lost. Get going before

                         you get hurt.

               As the guys disperse, Susan* stumbles over to the rear car door,

               opens it, and sits down.

               Apparently more interested in intimidating the guys than accually

               helping Susan ouc, Benny soon walks away. As soon as the coast

               is clear, Mike walks over near her. She is looking down and is

               barely conscious.

                                      MIKE

               She looks up at him, studies him for a second, then gestures for

               him to come closer.

                                       SUSAN

                         C'mere.      What's your name?

                        Yeah, I think so.    I know you.

              She grabs his hand and pulls him closer to her.       Soon he is

              sitting right next to her in the back seat.

                                  SUSAN

                        You're kind of cute.    Do you like

                        me?

                        Sure.

              She slowly pulls him down on top of her.



         86   EXT:   WOODS - NIGHT

              Jodi leads Pink into the woods. They are both kind of laughing.

              Suddenly Jodi stops, turns around, and is face-to-face with Pink,

              She kind of smiles and then puts an arm around his neck and

              starts kissing him. He willingly goes along. Soon they break.

           87   INT:   BACK SEAT OF PARKED CAR - NIGHT

                In the back seat of the car, Susan and Mike are kissing wildly.

                Soon her breasts are out of her shirt and Mike is all over them.

                If not quite sure what to do, he makes up for any lack of

                experi-ence with enthusiasm and curiosity.

                Suddenly Susan becomes coherent and pushes him off her.

                                    SUSAN

                          Stop!

                               (pushes him)

                          You fucker!

                Mike is surprised at her sudden rage and moves away a little.

                She then.kicks at him.

                                    SUSAN

                          Well fuck ALL of you!

                She kicks one more time as he gets up and out of the car. He

                looks back and she sort of shoots the finger at him but hardly

                seems focused on him at all. He moves away from the car but

                watches her try to button her shirt back up while she starts

                crying.

                Julie and Mitch are getting pretty cosy standing against a tree

                Benny, Hudson and a few others. Jodi and Pink come out of the

                woods and kind of smile at each other as they part. She holds up

                the joint and he just waves her off as if to say "keep it." As

                she keeps walking, he falls in with his crowd.

              Yeah, I know what you're talking

              second grade, in order Co gee words

              right on a spelling test, we used

              to make up sentences where the

              first letter in each word stands

              for a letter. Like arithmetic was

              'A rac in the house might eat the

              ice cream," and geography was

              "George eats old gray rats and

              paints houses yellow."

     Tony laughs.

              I'll probably be seventy years old

                 Darla storms off while Sabrina and Tony just kind of look at each

                 other like "what was that?" Mike walks over to them.

                 by some wild instinct, he starts to walk over to him.

         Clint's back is to Mike when he walks up to him. He holds a f'-ll

         beer in his hand and kind of glances around with a slight

         quizzical look on his face. He soon focuses on Clint and pours

         his entire beer over Clint's head. As a stunned Clint whir's

         around, Mike quickly drops the empty cup and punches Clint a

I        fairly good one in the face. Unfortunately for Mike, Clint

         recovers rather quickly, grabs Mike's shirt with one hand, and

         starts punching him with the other.

         As Tony. Pink, and Benny arrive to try to help break it up, they

         are shielded from the fight by a large wall of people circled

         around the nucleus of the fight. Contradictory to Mike's plan,

         no one in the immediate vicinity seems to want to break up the

         fight. Worse still, by being such eager spectators, they are

         actively shielding out those who want to help Mike.

                              PINK

                   Move it!

         Pink, Benny, and Tony (by following their lead) aggressively push

         their way through the crowd. Finally, as Mike continues to get

         the holy shit beat out of him, the guys break through and pull

         Clint off Mike.

                         the officers. Soon they are by the creek's edge.

      The police drive off. Once they're at a safe distance, Don and

             So all in all, did this beat

             playing cards tonight?

                       TONY

             Hmmm. Though I didn't win the

             money I would have at the poker

             table, it's okay because you guys

             paid for most of the breakfasc.

                       MIKE

             Just one question - how does she

             rate wich Lincoln?

They drive off.



INT: MITCH'S HOUSE - DAWN                                          105

Mitch walks into his house, chinking of his evening and smiling.

MITCH'S MOTHER is standing there and ha momentarily gets an

"obedient son* expression on his face. As if she's been

preparing for hours, she's not mad but rather reasonable when she

confrones him.

                       MITCH'S MOTHER

             Okay, ehis is your one. Your

             sister told me everything so I've

             decided eo make ehis deal with you.

             I'm going to try to be open-minded,

             but next time you come in at

             sunrise, we're going to have some

             trouble.

Mitch kind of shrugs his shoulders and raises his hands as if co

say "okay, good.* He concinuea on eo his room, slips off his

shoes and walks over eo his bed. Noe quice finished, his moeher

pokes her head in his room.

                        MITCH'S MOTHER

                   (concinuing)

             So what, are you drunk? And who's

closes his eyes.
