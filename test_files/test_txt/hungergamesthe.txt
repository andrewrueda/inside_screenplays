      destroyed    entirely.    The other twelve barely survived.

      When it was over, The Capitol     decreed that those twelve

      Districts - as a brutal   reminder of their     treasonous

      rebellion - would forever   suffer    a punishment,    once a year.

      It   was called      The Hunger Games."

      We run around a corner,  our heart rate spiking   -- a KNIFE,

      hurtling  at us out of nowhere. PFFFT! It buries    itself into

      But we have to keep running,   have to get                 to safety.   Our eyes

      away. Death waiting  inside all of them. Then:

      A SPEAR, thrown from what used to be a second-story window.

      We DIVE OUT of its way. It just misses us. But we've landed

      on that wounded arm. More searing pain.

      We get to our feet.  Please            let this end. Behind us we hear

                       (Katniss        waits)

                 What happens          if they         call    you at The

                                          call     me?



                                         I know that

                                 KATNISS

                 Don't worry. There'll                  be people with

                 their names in there                  lots more times

    A quiet,   somber feeling  in here, like dressing  for a funeral.

    Katniss  steps into a worn blue dress.    Prim, now 12, tucks a

    white blouse into a skirt.    Their mother opens a wooden box.

                                   MRS. EVERDEEN

                  I thought you might            like    to wear

                  this,  Prim.

    She shows     Prim a GOLDMOCKINGJAYPIN.                     Beautiful.

                                   PRIM

                             Prim takes the pin, tries

                  but her trembling   fingers

             steps in and does it for her.

    Katniss    turns      away - but            Prim grabs          her hand,    urgently:

                                       PRIM

                   They can't            take    you.      Tell     me they

    unnerving   all this is - then kisses                           the top of her head.

    A reassuring  smile - it                helps - until       Prim is led into the

                   This Day, like The Games themselves,

                   provides  us a chance to reflect        on

                   the costs of our violent      rebellion

                   all those years ago, and to be

    Haymitch rises   drunkenly  and gives the mayor an enthusiastic

    slap on the back. But when he tries     to hug Effie, he ends                            up

    Hayrnitch,       his     drunken      brain      catching         up,      shakes          his     head.

    So Katniss        keeps      corning ...         even as Prim grabs                     her.

    The Peacekeepers             lead     Katniss          away.    Prim shrieks,                    crying:

    Gale   carries          Prim off      as Katniss          mounts         the          steps.

    No one claps.            Instead,         they    do something                 else      - a gesture:

    In unison,   the people here touch the three middle fingers    of

    their  left hand to their    lips and then hold it out to her. It

    is a gesture    of immense respect.  Also a fond farewell •

    Katniss is escorted     into an elegant room by A PAIR OF

    PEACEKEEPERSwho retreat      and stand guard at the door. She

    sits on a velvet    couch. Then Prim and Mrs. Everdeen enter.

    Prim runs across the room and buries      her face in Katniss's

    lap, awash with tears.    Katniss  holds her tightly.     Mrs.

    Everdeen is outside    the hug, too bereft   to function.

                                  KATNISS

    Mrs.   Everdeen      half-nods,      breaking     down in sobs.

    Another    nod.      Prim clasps     Katniss's     face     in her        hands.

    INT. CAPITOL - TRAIN STATION - DAY

    Katniss  tries to hide her awe, but it's  an effort - because

    we've just pulled  into The Capitol - and it is dazzling.

    Hayrnitch and Effie          lead     the two junior       celebrities    through

    the station.  Feels          like     another planet       to Katniss.

    They pass a VIRTUAL NEWSSTAND.One face appears on DOZENS OF

                 No one's going to sponsor you looking

                 like this,     Katniss. Could you blame

                 them?

    A look    from Hayrnitch     tells   Katniss     not to fire      back.

    Katniss is naked, silent.  And surrounded:    eyebrows plucked                       by

    a man named FLAVIUS, nails  shaped by a portly     woman named

    A HUNDREDHANDSreach up to catch her kiss.       Wow. She looks

    down, noticing  now that she is squeezing   the color out of

    This    said   as if     she were handing          out     sandwiches.

    Katniss  spots the tiny little  wisp from District                               11 again.

    Rue, whose hand is trembling   so badly from fear                              that she

                   Johanna Mason, a few years ago - she

                   wept through the whole Training

                   never saw such a scared little

                   Then Day One of the Games she

                   hatcheted     six kids in two minutes!

                   And won! Sign, Dear. It's        late.

    Effie    hands her a pen and the                papers.  Katniss glances               at

    them,    then at Peeta. He nods.                She takes the pen ••.

    other Careers          (Districts      1, 2, and 4), blow out of here.

    notice ••• as Effie continues,  with no help from Haymitch:

                      Avoxes are criminals         of the State,

                      traitors.      They work - and they don't

    INT. CAPITOL - TRAINING CENTER - KATNISS'S ROOM- NIGHT

    A clean,    well-appointed           room. Katniss           enters,      miserable.

    Dinner is waiting   here for her. On a silver                           tray.     Steak,

    rice,  salad •.• and a scoop of ice cream.

    She smashes      the plates        to the      floor.       Backs away, reeling.

    But that fast,   her door opens - and a random, anonymous AVOX

     (female) enters with a tray.  The Avox kneels down to clean up

    the mess. Katniss turns,   embarrassed.

     ••• until something takes Katniss's breath                        away: the          face    of

    this Avox - because we've seen her before.

    She is Lavinia,    the red-haired                girl netted by that               hovercraft       *

    Katniss   enters the gym. The Garnesmakers                             barely turn.   Some of

    An AVOX just   walked    in with a ROASTED PIG on a tray.       The

    Garnesmakers now have their      backs completely  turned to

    Katniss.  It's  infuriating     - and her reaction   is instant:

                             like ....

                                 CINNA

                  Like the girl you were meant to be.

                  Let me see a twirl.

    She twirls,     almost     allowing      the    thrill     of it.

                                 CINNA (CONT'D)

                  Oh Katniss ...

                        (she blushes)

                  I hope the Sponsors              really  see you

                  tonight.   Like this.            The real you.

                                 KATNISS

                  Haymitch      says     I'm sullen      and hostile.

                                 CINNA

                  You are - around Haymitch.

                        (that helped)

                  Forget him tonight.     Once those

                  cameras are on, try to pretend you're

                  talking    to a best friend back home.

                  Do you have someone like that?





•                 Yeah. His name's

                  all this.

                                  KATNISS







                                  CINNA

                                            Gale.     But he hates





                  He loves      you,     though.     Doesn't    he.

                                  KATNISS

                  I dunno.

                                  CINNA

                  Well,    when you-see        me sitting        in that

                  audience,      pretend      I'm him. Can you do

                  that?

                        (she nods)

                  Listen,    I lied to you the other day -

                  about the reason I asked for District

                  12. It was you, Katniss.       What you did

                  for your sister,      how brave you were.

                  Tonight requires ... a different      kind

                  of bravery,     okay?

                        (that registered)

                  Let them love you out there.       It might

                  just save you .

                      I hope you've brought your appetite

                      for fun, because tonight     I go one-on-

    More APPLAUSE - as the Tributes   walk on stage,  single file,

    filling those waiting chairs.   Katniss is almost on stage when

    Haymitch tugs at her arm - eyeing her and Peeta.

                                  HAYMITCH

                      Remember, you're      still         a happy pair      -

                   stopped.  What did you think about

                   that costume?

    And Katniss         goes blank.      Silence.          Uh-oh ...

    Then she spots         Cinna,     in the         audience.       That helps.

                                    KATNISS

                   You mean after  I got over                     my fear    of

                   being burned alive?

                   Yes.     Start     then.

                                    KATNISS

                   I thought  Cinna was brilliant      and it

                   was the most gorgeous costume I'd

                   ever seen. I couldn't    believe    I was

                   wearing it. I can't   believe    I'm

                   wearing this either!

    Katniss  looks to Cinna, who makes the tiniest     circular    motion

    with his finger,  twirl  for me. Katniss hesitates     ... then:

    She twirls.         The Audience          eats    it    up.

                                    FLICKERMAN

                   Oh do that         again!

    She does      so.    More love      from the           Audience.

    A NURSE carrying           a nasty-looking             SYRINGE approaches                Katniss.

    their    arms, legs - then faces - both Tributes    from 1, both

    counting    again.     One, two, three--

    .•• until      a THUNDEROUSSOUNDsnaps              her head around.             She turns:

    ••• toward a horror -- TERRIFIED ANIMALS, bursting                          out of the

    woods in a STAMPEDE, coming this way ••.

    Because a WALL OF FLAMES is behind                  them - mountainous,              fast-

    moving - a FOREST FIRE, barrelling                  at us.

    Katniss       is spun around and nearly trampled    by the panicking

    animals.        She turns,  fleeing, carrying that jug like a

    football,        her backpack bouncing on her back.

    Suddenly,   everything    around her is on fire, every tree .•• She

    dodges a burning BRANCH, jumps over a burning LOG. But the

    tail  of her jacket    catches   on fire.

    She dives to the ground head-first,      rolls    over twice to

    smother the fire.     Then she's off again,    running alongside                          the

    animals,  their   panicked  screams adding to the terror.

    Searing pain in her            chest,  but she's         unburned.      She stuffs        the

    IMPLODING on the boulder              behind     her.

    She runs blindly,  eyes burning.   The FOURTHFIREBALL blazes

    across her left calf,  setting   it on fire. Instant agony.

    Fire bearing   down on her, that precipice     up ahead ••. Another

    HISS - another   FIREBALL coming at her. She's running,      crying,

    dying. And here comes the cliff.    It's   that or burn to death.

                  I just did. He said no. And asking

                  again would be viewed as an act of

                  dissent.

    Gale reacts     - awe and disgust.      Haymitch         reads        his     mind:

                  Our fathers         died together    - in the

                  mines. Did you know that?

                         (Haymitch shrugs)

                  It's    how I met her, getting          our

                  condolence         medals from the Mayor's

                  Office.       She was twelve - with a

                  little      sister     and a mother who was

                  falling       apart.    We started   hunting

                  together,        to keep our families       fed.

                  I'll    tell     you something about her and

                  those woods, they're            the only place I

                  ever saw her smile;           she has a talent

                  for them. The other Tributes             don't

                  know that yet, but they will.

                  Personally,          I don't think they have a

                  chance against          her. She's too good -

    makes a quiet cut on it. Gingerly.                 Silently. Then another.

    Now we get it; she wants to saw this branch off. Might take

    HOURS at this pace, but if she goes any faster     or makes any

    noise she'll  awaken the nest ... and the Careers.

    from below. One patient   cut after   another.    We CUT TO:

            sawed off. She looks down to Rue,

    Movement:      Cato,      beginning    to awaken.    Katniss   is   out of time.

    So she starts SAWING. Fast. Desperate.  The branch starts                     to

    crack. The BUZZING in the nest grows louder.   Cato looks                    up:

                                    CATO

                   Hey!

    Katniss saws,          fast as she can.      The knife slips   from her

    sweaty hands.          She grabs at it,      just barely  catches  it •

    .•• as the first     TRACKER-JACKERangrily  pops from the nest.

    It's  BIG, with a golden-torso.    Flying right  at us. It lands

    on Katniss's     knee. A STABBING PAIN as it stings  her.

    Another flies  at her            - stings her in the neck. More PAIN. She

    blocks it out, keeps             sawing - arm pumping, getting woozy.

    Rue hops to a distant     branch like a lemur. Below, the other

    But Glimmer and the Girl from 4 are caught in their  sleeping

    bags, quickly enveloped  in a CLOUDOF WASPS. Overwhelmed.

    The Girl from 4, half-insane   now, runs into a tree,     staggers,

    disappears  behind a rock. Glimmer shrieks,   tries    to swat the

    wasps with that bow, taking dozens of stings;      then she falls.

    Her body begins        to spasm, twitching  madly. Then, death.         The

    Tracker-Jackers        depart.  And an odd SILENCE returns ...

    Katniss    is alone,     (Rue nowhere in sight).  She pulls the

    stingers     from her    knee and neck, then descends the tree ...

    EXT. BASE OF THE TREE - MOMENTSLATER

    She reaches     the ground, bearing   her backpack.   Already,  WELTS

    are growing     from the stings.   Her calf still   searing •••

    She approaches   the      body of Glimmer, warily.  It's         barely human

    now - face distorted        out of proportion.  And still         breathing.

    The tip    of that     BOWpeeks   out   from beneath     her.

    Katniss reaches  under the faintly-breathing               body to extract

    the bow. Glimmer's eyes flicker.     Katniss           avoids them, grabs

    the bow. Then the TEN ARROWS  .••

    They're still   clutched  in Glimmer's fist.  Katniss    tries   to

    pry the fingers    away. Glimmer holds tight  - fighting,      even

    now. Her face a balloon,     blood and GREEN OOZE everywhere.

    Katniss  hears a CANNON, sees a HOVERCRAFTdescending  not far

    from here to get the Girl from 4. Soon, the craft will be

    coming for Glimmer - so this has to be done:

    A moment later,           bow drawn,         she surfaces         - ready          to fire.

    But no one's coming. The woods are still,    until  they start   to

    move in a hallucinogenic  way, swaying.   Suddenly,  ANTS appear

    out of thin air, floating  toward her. IMAGES, wobbling:

    her lips       to Rue's temple, releases   Rue's tiny hand.

    Then she looks           up, wanting those unseen cameras                 above to see

    her rage. It's           hard to miss. She rises •••

    EXT. RUE'S CLEARING - MOMENTSLATER



    Katniss   decorates Rue's body with flowers,  one stem at a

    time. Covering Rue's wound, wreathing    her head, weaving

    petals  through Rue's hair.  A sad, loving farewell •

     ••• until     all we can see of Rue is her tiny face.                     Then Katniss

    tenderly       affixes that mockingjay pin on to Rue's                     clothes.

    People       from Katniss's        District     watch,    weeping,       as:

    Katniss   stands, almost at attention       - and gives Rue that

    SILENT SALUTE we've seen twice now: three fingers          to the                                 *

    Then the       people in this Square, unseen by Katniss,                        return      the

    Katniss  wanders,  her guard down, too sad to be afraid. Then

    she stumbles   onto something that makes her feel even worse:

    Rue's      signal fire, still smoking. Katniss                   sags,      lost.     She

    hears      two GROOSLINGSon a branch above •.•

    The Grooslings         cook.    Smoke wafts        up.   Katniss     doesn't         care.

    Gale lies on a bunk - in the musty, stale   air of the AVOX

    BARRACKS- 5,000 silenced   souls around him. An everpresent TV

    just showed him Katniss, saying that name: Peeta •..

    Gale swallows a reaction ... as TINY FEET rumble past:                                 A TEN

    YEAR-OLDBOY, chasing    a GIRL through these barracks.

    The boy has fashioned             a fake BOW-AND-ARROW  from a stick and

    two knotted   shoelaces,           pretending  to shoot at his quarry.

    Gale watches,   touched.           Saddened too. Then a HUGENOISE, as:

    The barrack     doors     burst     open.    FIVE PEACEKEEPERS, shouting:

    clearly.      The Avoxes scramble into lines before their                            bunks,

    Then, a hand on his arm. He looks down. It's   the Ten Year-Old

    Hurrying - through rows of bunks, hidden                           by all the

    commotion, with the Peacekeepers  not far                          behind,  until:

    The Boy points   to the floor beneath a random bunk. Huh? The

    Boy points  again •.. until  Gale looks beneath the bunk:

    There's      a GRATE in the floor. Oh. Gale kneels down, lifts  the

    grate.      A HOLE beneath it. He climbs in, replaces the grate •

    No reply. Then she sees it, something   uneven about the

    contour of his mud-caked leg. He shrugs,   won't explain.

    So she brushes away some of the                 gunk camouflaging       him - until

    She grabs      his     hands     and yanks    him to his       feet.     Literally.

    He staggers,          utterly    unable to bear his own weight.                    She

    Then, a STARTER'S PISTOL FIRES. And before Katniss   can blink,

    FoxFace emerges from inside  the Cornucopia itself,  swipes the

    "#5" bag, and vanishes  into the woods again.  In mere seconds.

    Katniss shakes her head, impressed.    Stillness                         returns.    No

    movement in the trees.  She steels  herself.

                Okay, Peeta.         Here we go ...

    air,    gashing her forehead.   Katniss staggers,  drops to a knee.

    Clove is running right  at us now - arm bleeding,    eyes lethal.

    A KNIFE IN EACH HAND. Katniss  tries to draw back an arrow,

    but there's  no time. She's a goner. Clove, barrelling    in--

    Then,     shockingly,           Clove     is   knocked       sideways,         on to her back .

    ••• by a rock the size of a volleyball,                             hurled from the

    darkness.   Clove quivers on the ground                            - disoriented,  bloody.

    Katniss     is    almost        as confused         as Clove         is.     Who threw      that?

    Then Thresh         emerges ••.          to re-claim         the     rock     he just     threw.

    He stands over           Clove,      lifts    it     into the         air, and brings it

    down on Clove's           skull.       Katniss       watches,         awed. CANNONBLAST.

    Then, suddenly,  the rain stops - as if a faucet had been

    turned off. The skies clear in an instant,   the forest floor

    filling with sunshine.   It feels jarring, ominous.

    The WILD DOGS. "MUTTATIONS." Murderous and huge. Cato blows

    right by us, unslowed by the Kevlar BODYARMORhe's wearing.

    Katniss turns,    runs for her life.                         Peeta     too     - hobbling.         Both

    climbing     the wall - desperately.                      Adrenaline rocketing •..

    She gets there ... onto its FLAT SURFACE- and she and Cato

    square off instantly   - Cato drawing a sword, Katniss her bow.

    But,   incredibly,           the LEAD MUTTATIONbounds that                             ten-foot        high

    wall   in a single           bound, barrelling into Cato.

    As they battle,  Katniss   turns - to see Peeta, hobbling                                         this

    way. The PACK gaining    on him fast. Her eyes go wide.

    Peeta gets to the base of the Cornucopia,   starts to climb.

    MUTTATION#2 swipes at his legs with FOUR-INCH RAZORCLAWS.

    Instant  blood. Instant agony. Peeta howls.

    Katniss    fires an arrow                 right     into     the     throat        of the    beast.         It

    falls   back, dead.

                                           KATNISS

                     Climb,         Peeta!

    He's   trying.          But the        other      Muttations         get    to his      heels,        as:

    Cato stabs the Lead Muttation.  A death-blow.                                      He shoves      the

    Muttation  away. It lands at Katniss's   feet.

    They ALL have human eyes.                      Tribute       eyes.   Eery   as hell.

    from the Muttations is a disorienting     din .••

                   You're         right.

    She lets it fly - an arrow aimed right      at Cato's hand.

    slams back against    him. They might both go over, as:
