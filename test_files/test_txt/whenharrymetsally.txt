    CARD:      TEN YEARS AGO



    A couple     in a clinch.

    The young man involved   is named HARRYBURNS. He's 26

    years old, just graduated   from law school. Wearing

    jeans and a sweatshirt.

    He's kissing    a young woman named AMANDA. She has long

    straight   hair that she irons.    She's about 20.  The

    embrace is fairly    melodramatic.   They pull back to look

    at one another.

                                         AMANDA

                  I love you.

                                         HARRY

                  I love     you.

    They begin     to kiss      again.

                                                                 (CONTINUED)

            2     A car pulls        up right   beside    them.    Stops.         Sits     there.                   2



                  Driving the car is SALLY ALBRIGHT. She's 21 years old.

                  She's very pretty   although not necessarily         in an

                  obvious way. She sits there waiting         for the kiss to

                  end.   It doesn't  end.    She clears    her throat.     They

                  don't hear her.    She shifts   position    and accidentally-

                  on-purpose  hits the car HORN, which beeps and startles

                  Amanda and Harry into breaking off their clinch.

                  Amanda sees Sally,   and she and Harry move over to the

                  car.

                                                 AMANDA

                             Oh. Hi, Sally.        Sally -- this            is

                                Nice to meet you.

                  They shake       hands.

                                                SALLY

                                           (to Harry)                                                      *

                                You want to drive the first            shift?

                                                HARRY

                                No, no -- you"re there already,               you

                                can start.

                  Harry   looks      meaningfully    at Amanda.

                  Then he starts    to put his stuff -- a duffel bag, a box

                  of records    -- into the back seat of the car, where

                  Sally's   stuff is, too -- suitcases,  stereo speakers, a

                  guitar,   boxes of books, a small TV.

                                                     AMANDA                                                     *

                                  I'll   call   as soon as I get there.

                                                     AMANDA                                                     *

                                  Call   me from the road.

                                                      HARRY                                                     *

                                  I'll   call   before that.

                     The story of my life isn't  even

                     going to get u~ out of Chicago.    I

                     mean, nothing's  happened to me yet.

                     That's why I'm going to New York.

                                        HARRY

                     So something     can happen to you.

                                        SALLY

                     happen to other people.

                     Suppose nothing happens to you.

                     never meet anyone and you never

                     become anything and finally     you die

              It doesn"t mean you"re deep or

     IT'S   FIVE YEARSLATER.

     A   couple    in a clinch.

     The woman is Sally at 26.    She looks great,    she's a

     stylish-young·woman~-  She •s ki--ssing a very attractive

     man with·a beard, although it"s not that easy to see

     him at the moment. His name is JOE.

     Harry is coming down the hallway of the airline

     terminal.    He"s wearing a suit and tie and trenchcoat;

     he has a kind of attractive-but-rumpled      demeanor.  He

     notices   the couple kissing.     Goes past them.  Then

     stops.    Backs up.  Berecognizes them.

     They're      still      kissing.

     Harry comes closer,                peers     at the two of them from

     slightly     too close.             It's     not easy to s- either   of

     their    faces.      ·

     Finally,      Sally and Joe become aware that someone is

     standing      nearby, and they stop kissing  to look at

     Harry.

                                                HARRY

     Joe holds       out his      hand.          They shake.

                  to be able to aay to me, how come

     cute and plump, a married lady.

     Sally comes in and sits down as the others              finish

     giving their drink order to the WAITER.

                           (to Waiter)

                Here's what I want.    I want a

                CAJ11pariand soda, but here's how I

                want it.   I want the CAJ11pari in a

                glass with ice, and the soda on the

                side, but in a bottle.    I don't

                want the soda in a glass,    I want to

                mix it myself.

     corner of it and places it in a section          at the back            •

     of.the  box. Then she pulls out another card.

     A wave is   in progress.  It sweeps around the stadium

     and passes by Harry and his friend,    JESS, sitting    in

     the second deck, surrounded   by Mets fans.    It's  fall,

     they're  both wearing jeans and windbreakers.

     Harry   is very    despondent.

                                       JESS

                  When did this       happen?

                    any more.•      You know, like it's      the

                    institution,     like it's    nothing personal,

                    like it's    just something she's thinking

                    about in a kind of casual way.           I'm calm.

                    I say, why don't we think about it,

                    Next day she says she's thought about it,

                    she wants a trial     separation.       She just

                    wants to~        it, she says.      We can still

                    date, she says, like this is supposed to

                    cushion the blow.       I mean, I got married

                    so I could stop dating,        so I don't     see

                    where •we can still       date• is a big incentive

                    since as far as I'm concerned         the last

                    thing you want to do is date your wife,

                    who's supposed to love you, which is

                    what I'm saying to her when it crosses

                    my mind maybe she doesn't,         so I say,

                    "Don't you love me anymore?" and you

                    know what she says?        I don't know if

                    I"ve ever loved you.

                            one ever tells           you.     I would sit around

                            with my girlfriends              who had kids --

                            well, actually,            my one girlfriend        who

                             had kids, Alice,           and she would complain

                             about how she and Gary never did it

                             any more.        She didn't       even complain about

                            said it matter-of-factly.                  They were up

                            all night,        they were both exhausted             all

                            the time,the          kids just took

                            every sexual impulse they had out of them,

                            and Joe and I used to talk                  about it and

                            say, we're so lucky, we have this wonderful

                            relationship,          we can have sex on the kitchen

                            floor and not worry about the kid walking

                            in, we can fly off to Rome on a moment's

                            notice,     and then one day I was taking

                            Alice's     little       girl for the afternoon.           I'd

                            promised to take her to the circus,                    and we         •

                            were in a cab playing              "I spy• -- you know,

                            I spy a lamppost,            I spy a mailbox -- and she               •

                            looked out the window and there was this

                            man and this woman with two little                   kids,

                            the man had one of the kids on his shoulders,

                            and Alice's        little     girl said,      "I spy a

                            family,•      and I started         to cry.      You know,

                         and hard Mexican ceramic tile.

                         Anyway, we talked about it for a long

                         time, and I said, this is what I want,

                         over him. I really      am over him. That

                         was it for him, that was the most he

                         could give, and every time I think about                    it,

                         I'm more and more convinced I did the

     As Harry continues     to stare at the bird, we hear a few

     Harry is trying to hang a picture     in what is an

     otherwise virtually  empty apartment.     He checks the

     picure for placement against the wall,

     Harry is sitting    in his one chair,   t:ying to read a

     book. He has a thermometer      in his mouth. He can't

     concentrate.     He keeps reacling the same paragraph

                                        time.   It might be months before

                                        we"re actually  able to enjoy going

                                        out with someone new.

                                        new.

     It's  Christmas    in New York.     Sally and Harry, bundled

     up against    the cold, a.re standing      at the Christmas

     tree stand on the corner,      trying    to figure  out which

     one to buy.      Sally finally   chooses one and pays for it.

     She and Harry pick it up together,            one holding the top

     and the other the bottom,  and start           to carry i.t to

     a tabla  writing    names on Christmas   cookies with her friend,

     Amy puts her hand out, as if she was going to be mani-

     We know it's   New Year"s Eve because people are wearing

     funny hats and there's    one of those mi=ored    things

     hanging from the ceiling    and casting   twinkle  lights on

     a fairly  large crowd of revelers     in a large room some-

     where in Manhattan.

     A  band is playing.               Harry    and Sally   are   dancing.   Harry      •

     dips her.

     They dance for a moment.         He glances at Sally and

     for a split    second we see the beginnings     of some-

     thing ... an inkling ... a little    tender moment.

     Sally   and her friend,    Marie,       walking      down the       street   on

     their   way to a restaurant.

                                         SALLY

                 Sixty dollars    I spent on this big

                 stupid  arrangement    of flowers,   and

                 I wrote a card that     I planned  to

                 leave out on the front table where

                 Arthur would just happen to see

                 it   --

                 He didn't    even come over.            He

                 forgot    some charity  thing          his wife

                 was chairman of.

                 I can't     believe         I'm doing   this.

                                    SALLY

                 Look, Harry is one of my best friends,                                   *

                 and you are one of my best friends,

                 who doesn't   know your friends.

                                  MARIE

                 You and I haven't    drifted apart

                 since I started   seeing Arthur.

                 actually  met him, I'm sure you and

                 I would drift  apart.

                 He's     never      going to leave      her.

                       personality,     she could be either.

                       She could be not attractive          with a

                       good personality,      or attractive     with

                       a good personality.

                   It's  not just that she always picks

     Marie looks         at him.        Of course   she doesn't            like   his   bar

     stools.

     Jess    turns      to Harry    for    help.

     Harry, we now see, has sat down in a lone                         chair by the

     window and he's staring out like a forlorn                         figure in a

     Magritte painting.

     No response         from Harry.

     They've made love.     Both of them lying                   in bed, Sally

     is in Barry's  arms.    Sally has a smile                   on her face.

     Barry stares  straight   ahead.

                                                 SALLY

                     You comfortable?

                                    SALLY

     Sally at the sink,           running      some water      into    two glasses

     with ice.

     Harry lying in Sally"s  bed, still  staring  straight

     ahead.   In the room is a stuffed  animal of some sort,

     maybe Sally"s  old teddy bear, a pink quilt.

     Harry is sitting up in bed, with                 the   light      on,    looking

     through a box of index cards.

     Sally   gets     into     bed next     to him.

     A silence      while      Harry desultorily       goes through           the box.

     Unbelievably       awkward.

      Every SOUNDis louder than it actually     is. The

      riffle of the index cards.    Sally taking a gulp of

      water.  Harry rearranging  his pillow.

                  my friend     Louise.       She says to me,

                  let's   go get an ice cream soda at

                  Walgreen's.        We always went to

                  Walgreen's.        So we get there,       we

                  sit down at the counter           and I say,

                  let me have a black and white,

                  that's    a chocolate       soda with

                  vanilla    ice cream, and you know

                  what the guy says to me? We're out

                  of vanilla      ice cream.       How can you

                  be out of vanilla         ice cream?      So

                  Louise says,       order something else,

                  but my heart is set on a black and

                  white.     So we go over to Armstrong-

                  Shroeder,     where you should know I

                  never went in my whole life before

                  or since.      So there we are,

                  friend Stanley,        who's just bought a

                  new car.      A Deusen.berg, he tells

                  me, come to the street           and see it.

                  so there I am, looking at the car,

                  when who should come up but this

                  handsome man --

                  kind is it?"        A Deusenberg,      I tell

                  him.

                       I am?      I'm the dog?

                                             HARRY

                     Yes.

                       I'm the dog?

      People are starting            to notice           the         intensity     of the

      conversation.

      Sally is really   furious now. She starts  toward a large

      screen that's   a few feet from the end of the room, thin.king

      they    can   get    some privacy           if    she     gets      behind     it.

                             I don"t see that,      Harry.    If

                             anyone's    a dog, you a.re the dog.

                             To you this is something that just

                             happened and you think you can say

•                            great,   it happened,    now let's  get

                             on with it, we'll      go back to the way

                             it was, like what happened didn't

                             mean anything     --

                They reach the screen,   but there's   no getting  behind it

                -- there are folded chairs and the bass player's        bass

                case and the drummer's drwn suitcases,     etc.   Sally

                reverses   and starts toward a door out of the room.

                Harry follows.

                             I'm not saying it didn't     mean

      The entire     wedding   party   is   assembled   around   the   band-

      stand.

      The band is PLAYING some kind of musical riff          that

      signals  that attention     must be paid.    Sally comes to a

      stop.   Harry is just behind her.       There's   a crowd of

      guests assembled    in a knot with Jess and Marie, their

      arms around each other,      standing there with their

      champagne glasses.      Jess is in front of the microphone.

           Marie takes         her wedding bouquet           and lobs   it   into   the

           air straight         at Sally.

           For a moment we think that Sally isn't going to make a move

           for it, she's just going to let it land on the floor.

           Sally,     in jeans and a plaid jacket,       has just bought her

           ~hristmas       tree, and the salesman has finished       putting

           plastic      netting  around  it.  Sally starts    to carry the tree.

           It's    very heavy, the top of it is dragging         slightly    behind

           her and she's leaving a little          trail  of pine needles behind

           her as she starts        home, but she's going to carry this damn

           tree home alone if it kills        her.

           As we watch her carry          the tree          home, we hear     a BEEP on

           Sally's machine.

                        I can't       stand the thought                 of not

                        kissing       somebody.

    She turns        to go.

    She stops        dead in her tracks.

    It's    Harry.

    Slowly he comes towards                her,     and stops   in front     of her.

                                            HARRY

                     I've been doing a lot of thinking.

                     And the thing is, I love you.                                       •

                     this?

                                            HARRY

                     How about you love me, too?                                         •

    Sally    tu..s-ns and walks off,              parting   the crowd.

    Harry    follows         her like     a te=ier.

                                            HARRY

                     Doesn't what I said              mean anything

                     to you?

    During the following,        we hear the countdown to the New

    Year, after which eve:-yone breaks into "Happy New

    Year•, confetti    flies,     eve:-yone is kissing   and breaking

    into Auld Lang Syne.

                                    SALLY

               What is it supposed to mean? I'm                                          •

               sor:-y, Harry.        I know it's  New Year's Eve

               and I know you're feeling         lonely,  but

               you can't      just show up here and tell me

               you love me and expect that to make it all

               right.     I mean, what am I supposed to say?

               Great, Harry, you love me, that settles           every-

               thing,    now we can waltz off into the sunset

               together?        It doesn't  work this way.
