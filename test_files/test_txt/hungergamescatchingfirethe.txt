EXT. WOODS - DAWN

Silence . A sublime landscape of fog and trees.

Katniss Everdeen sits silently, her bow ready .

ECU -- Her eyes. Haunted . A thousand yard stare .

                        GALE (O.S . )

          Katniss ...

She spins -- panicked, terrified -- alilling r ight at Gale

Hawthorne, approaching from behind . He lifts his hands .

                    GALE (CONT'D)

          Whoa-- easy-- Don't shoot .

She recovers -- exhaling . Lowers her bow . He smiles .

                    GALE (CONT'D)

          Not yet, anyway .

He approaches, amused, unslings his bow, checks his arrows,

readying for the hunt . Her eyes take him in .

                    GALE (CONT' D)

          saw a bunch of turkeys on the way,

          crossed right in front of me . Like

          I wasn't even there .

                        KATNISS

          How rude of them.

                        GALE

          That's what happens, you spend six

          days a week workin' in the mine .

          Stupid birds start to think they

          own these woods .

She grins . He finishes his prep, gives her a look .

                    GALE (CONT ' D)

          When's the tour leave?

                        KATNISS

          Couple of hours .

They share a look . He turns.

                    GALE

          Better get started .



                                                           2.



EXT, WOODS - EARLY MORNING

Katniss and Gale hunt together . They share the easy intimacy

of many years doing this . The morning woods are beautiful .

They check traps, gather game, re-set traps .

Absorbed in hunting, Katniss loses the worry in her face.

It's as close to happy as she gets . Gale lets her lead, so he

can gaze at her. We see his love and longing.



EXT . WOODED GLADE - LATER

Katniss and Gale walk through a glade, belts carrying a

couple of rabbits, a few grouse, etc . Katniss raises a hand.

Gale looks at her . She nods into the distance. A flock of

turkeys is waddling through dappled sunlight.

Gale and Katniss share a glance. She lifts her bow. A male

turkey lifts its head . Katniss takes careful aim. Katniss

shoots . Suddenly, it is Marvel -- the boy from District One

who gets an arrow through the neck .

Katniss CRIES OUT, drops her bow and un-shot arrow, coming

out of her flashback. She turns away from Gale -- trembling,

upset . He goes and tri es to comfort her .

                     GALE

          It's okay, you're safe, you're

          right here .. . with me ...

He touches her but she pulls away. Slowly -- on her own --

she pulls herself together . All he can do is watch . Finally,

she turns -- under control but still fragile .

                    KATNISS

          We better go.



EXT. WOODS - DAY

Katniss and Gale hide their bows and arrows in the hollow of

a tree .



EXT. FENCE - DAY

Snow is falling lightly. Katniss and Gale approach the rusty

fence surrounding the town . It's not electrified . They duck

under . Below, we see the layout of District 12.



                                                             3.





EXT . DIRT ROAD - DAY

Katniss and Gale walk down a road, carrying their game . Snow

mixes with mud . Behind in the distance, giant industrial

mining machinery with a Capitol logo looms .

Corning the other way is a troupe of MINERS, blanketed in coal

dust . Gaunt, weary . A few YOUNG MINERS among them . They pass

without acknowledgement . Katniss catches a look -- envy?

Resentment? -- from a young GIRL MINER.

WIDE -- They pass a large billboard : an illustration of a

troupe of clean, healthy, smiling miners walking forward,

united . It reads, "Working For •A Better Tomorrow" .



EXT. THE HOB - DAY

They approach the Hob . Shacks dot the muddy path . Wood boards

have been laid to span boggy puddles . Dirty-faced CHILDREN

and weathered MOTHERS peer out of wood doorways .



INT . THE HOB - DAY

Morning bustle. Katniss watches as Gale chats with Greasy

Sae, t rading small game for various sundries . An old woman,

RIPPER, puts a couple of small bottles of moonshine on her

stall counter. Katniss hands her a coin.

                    RIPPER

          Don't pay with chipmunks anymore,

          do ya?

They trade smiles . Katniss turns, pocketing the bottles .



EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE HOB - DAY

Katniss and Gale stand in the alley . She doesn't notice him

checking to make sure they are alone .

                     KATNISS

           You coming to the station?

                        GALE

          I think you'll have plenty enough

          people saying goodbye without me

          there.

                    KATNISS

          Only a few I care about.



                                                           4.





                    GALE

          Still. Might be easier if I didn't .

                    KATNISS

          It's only a month . I'll be back

          before the snow melts .

                    GALE

          A lot can happen in a month .

She gets the meaning of that, stops and turns to hirn.

                    KATNISS

          We going to do this again?

He looks around, anywhere, but directly at her . She shakes

her head frustrated, then--

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Gale. It was an .fil.1 .

                    GALE

          Was a good one .

She looks at him -- why's he being this way?

                       l<ATNISS

          I did what I did to survive . I had

          to . If I didn't, I'd be dead .

He finally nods, steps forward.

                       GALE

          I know ...

And before she knows it, he takes her face in his hands,

kisses her.

She is surprised. She kisses back but her hands stay by her

side. He breaks away. She looks at him, stunned .

                   GALE (CONT'D)

          And~ had to do that . At least

          once .

He looks at her , turns and wal ks off. Suddenly self-

conscious, she looks around . No one was watching .



EXT. VI CTOR'S VILLAGE, GATE - DAY

Katniss walks a l ong a garden path by the entrance gate . A

sign reads, "Victor's Village".



                                                              5.





At a fountain, Buttercup is lapping water from a break in the

ice. The cat turns, HISSES at her . She hisses back .

                     KATNISS

           Like I care .



EXT. HAY?-fITCH' S HOUSE, VICTOR'S VILLAGE - DAY

Katn i ss knocks on the front door . Left slightly ajar, it

swings open slightly. From inside comes SNORING .



INT . BAYMITCH ' S BOUSE - DAY

Katn iss steps into a grimy kitchen . Bayrnitch is snoring, face

on the table , empty bottles and a glass by his side .

                     KATNISS

           Baymitch. Wake up . Tour Day.

She nudges him. Nothing . Shakes him. She steps back and looks

at him, empathy on her face. Then s he turns.

QUICK CUTS -- The stove is lit . Coffee is made. A jug filled

with water .

Katniss pours the jug over Haymitch's head. With a roar, he

comes to life, flailing a knife, knocking over empty bottles .

                     BAYMITCH

           What are you doing?

                      KATNISS

           You tol d me to wake you--

She leaps out of his way onto the window sill .

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           Cameras'll be here in an hour!

He looks down a t himself .

                     BAYMITCH

           Why am I wet?

                      KATNISS

               (s hrugs )

           You wouldn"t wake up .

He makes a move for her, but she kicks the table over from

her perch, b locking him . He looks at her .



                                                            6.





                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          If you want to be babied, you

          should've asked Peeta.

                    PEETA ( 0. S , )

          Asked me what?

They turn . Peeta steps in, holding two loaves of bread .

Katniss watches as Peeta now rights the table . He's now

stronger, looks healthy, a bit of snow in hi s hair .

                    HAYMITCH

          Asked you to wake me without giving

          me pneumonia .

Haymitch slides his knife over to Peeta, points a finger at

Katniss .

                    HAYMITCB (CONT'D)

          You are a strangely dislikable

          person .

She takes out the little bottles of moonshine and sets them

on the counter .

                    KATNISS

          From Ripper .

                    HAYMITCB

              (opening one)

          But you do have your virtues.

Peeta wipes the blade on his shirttail , starts to slice the

bread . Be gives a piece to Baymitch and now, for the first

time since he's walked in, looks at Katniss.

                    PEETA

          Would you like some?

                     KATNISS

          No. I ate at the Bob.

              (then)

          But thank you .

                     PEETA

          You're welcome.

Haymitch turns and watches the awkward, uneasy glance between

Peeta and Katni ss .

                     HAYMITCH

          Brrr . You two got a lot of warming

          up to do before show time .



                                                           7.





He takes a long pull of the moonshine. She forces a smile at

Peeta--

                     l<ATNISS

           Guess I'll see you later .

Be nods . She pivots on the si'll, looks over her shoulder--

                     l<ATNISS (CONT 'D )

           Take a bath, Haymitch.

And like that, she's out the window.



INT . KATNISS'S HOUSE - DAY

Through a window, we SEE Katniss approaching up the walk.

ANGLE -- Katniss comes through the door to be confronted by

her Mother, anxiety on her face, and Prim behind her.

                     MOTBER

           You have a good walk?

                      KATNISS

                (puzzled )

           I 've been out with

                       PRIM

           -- We ' ve got visitors !

A Presidential Guard appears from behind them.

                     PRESIDENTIAL GUARD

           Miss Everdeen? This way .



INT . /EXT . STUDY - DAY

The Guard opens the door, waves her in . The door shuts.

Someone is sitting in a chair, his back to her, watching a re-

run of the 74th Hunger Garnes on the TV. The final moments of

Katniss and Peeta holding the poison berries.

                     SNOW

           Such bravery. Spirit . Such ...

The frame freezes. The man spins around . President Snow. Cup

of tea in his hand . White rose in his lapel. Katniss is

frozen with terror .

                       SNOW (CONT'D)

           Contempt?



                                                         8.





                     KATNIS S

           President Snow. What an honor .

Snow smiles at this , puts down his tea .

                     SNOW

           My dear. We' ll make this simpler if

           we agree not to lie to each other .

           What do you think?

                      KATNISS

           Yes, I t hink that wou ld save time .

Be considers her a moment, then- -

                       SNOW

           My advisors were concerned you'd be

           di fficult . But you're not planning

           on being difficult, p.re you?

                      KATNISS

           No ,

                          SNOW

            That's what I told them. I said any

            girl who goes to--

                 ( l ook:; a t tile TV )

            --such lengths to preserve her life

            won't be i nterested in throwing it

          . away .

                 (turns back to her)

            And then there's her family to

            t hink of .

She looks at him. The word "family" hanging there, bringing

her a chill . He smiles.

                       SNOW (CONT'D)

           Pl ease . Sit down .

He sit s down at the old desk. She across from him.

                      SNOW (CONT'D)

           I have a problem, Miss Everdeen. A

           problem that began the moment you

           revealed t hose poison berries in

           the arena.

She says nothing , shows him noth i ng .



                                                 9.





                     SNOW (CONT'D)

          If the head Gamemaker, Seneca

          crane, had had any brains he'd have

          blown you to dust, then and there,

          but he had an unfortunate

          sentimental streak, so here you

          are.

              ( sits back)

          I expect you can guess where he is?

                     KATNISS

          I think so.

                     SNOW

          After that fiasco there was nothing

          left to do but let you play out

          your little scenario. And you were

          very good, that whole love crazed

          besotted schoolgi rl routine .

          Impressive . You conJinced the

          people in the Capitol .

              (then)

          Unfortunately, not everyone in the

          districts fell for it.

Be sees the question in her face .

                     SNOW (CONT'D)

          You don't know but in several of

          them, people viewed your little

          trick with the berries as an act of

          defiance, not an act of love. And

          if a girl from District 12, of all

          places, can defy the Capitol and

          walk away unharmed, what is to

          prevent them from doing the same -

          what is to prevent, say, an

          uprising ... ?

        her stiffen, smiles .

                     SNOW (CONT'D )

          That word gives you pause. Me, too .

          Uprising . They've been known to

          lead to revolutions. And then, in a

          mere fraction of time, the whole

          system collapses .

                    KATNISS

          Must be a fragile system if it can

          be brought down by a few berries.

        back, amused by her impudence .



                                                        10.





                     SNOW

          But it i s i ndeed, though not in the

          way you imagine .

                     KATNISS

           Bow should I imagine?

He is suddenly deadly seri ous .

                       SNOW

          You should imagine thousands upon

          thousands of people dead. This town

          of yours reduced to ash. Imagine it

          gone. Made radioactive, a.nd then

          buried in the dirt as if it never

          exi sted .

                (then)

          Like Di strict 13.

Any courage she had a moment agG, is now gone.

                    SNOW (CONT'D)

          You fought hard in the games, Miss

          Everdeen, but they were just games .

          Would you like to be in a real war .

                      KATNISS

          No.

Be l ooks at her. Sees she understands.

                    SNOW

          Good. Neither would I.

Be gets up, moves to where a plate of frosted cookies sits on

the tea tray . She says to his back ...

                     KATNISS

          I never meant to start any ...

          uprisings.

                    SNOW

          Oh, I believe you . But it doesn't

          matter, now does it?

Be turns, his black gloved hand holding up a cookie in his

handkerchief.

                    SNOW (CONT'D)

          Your mother made these ... ?

                      KATNISS

          Peeta.



                                                         1 1.





                     SNOW

              (he smiles)

          Lovely boy . So tal ented . Tell me,

          at what point did he realize the

          depth of your indifference to him?

                     KATNISS

          I 'm not indifferent .

                    SNOW

              (a cautionary finger)

          Please. You promised. No lying .

Snow dips the cookie in his cup of tea, takes a bite .

                      SNOW ( CONT ' D)

          Mmm, de l ici ous ! People forget t hat

          a President needs to eat .

                    KATNISS

          Why don't you just kill me now?

Be l ooks at her, chewing on the cookie, as if he's actually

considering it, or has considered it . Finally--

                      SNOW

          I don 't want to kill you .



Be keeps looking at her . Offers her a cookie ...

                    SNOW (CONT'D )

          I want us to be friends .

              (she doesn't take it)

          or if not friends, at least allies .

          Why not? We already have so much in

          common.

                      KATNISS

          such as?

                    SNOW

          Both of us are the sort who will do

          whatever's necessary to get what we

          want. Whatever's necessary to win.

                    KATNISS

          What do I need to do?

                     SNOW

          When you and Peeta are on tour, you

          will smile , you will be grateful ...

          but above all, you will be in love .

                    SNOW (CONT'D)

          You will be a love-struck girl who

          didn't know what she was doing . Who

          was just following her heart . Do

          you think you can manage that?

                       KATNISS

          Yes.

                       SNOW

          Yes, what?

                    KATNISS

          I'll convince them.

Snow leans in close, his eyes without artifice of any kind.

                     SNOW

          Aim higher, convince~ -

Snow hands her the rose, stands. Passing the TV, he flicks a

button . On the screen i s a telephoto shot of Katniss and

Gale, in the woods behind the Hob. Katniss is stunned, Snow

gets to the door, turns back .

                    SNOW (CONT'D)

          For the sake of your loved ones .

He exits. Katniss exhales deeply . Suddenly, she is trembling.

She turns, l ooks at Gale kiss her on the TV.



EXT. VICTOR'S VILLAGE - DAY

In the background, lights and cameras are being set up . Into

FRAME steps EFFIE TRINKET. She exhales -- the returning

queen.

                       EFFIE

          Just look at it, would you? This

          is . . . sacred ground. History was

          made on this site.

Oct avia and Flavius step up behind her. Look doubtful . Effie

glances back.

                    EFFIE (CONT 'D )

          You get used to the smell .



INT. KATNISS'S HOUSE - DAY

Katniss comes down t he stairs as her Mother is letting in

Effie, followed by Flavius and Octavia . Effie, in an orange

wig, sees Katniss and opens her arms ...



                                                         13 .



                    EFFIE

          And there she is. My greatest

          triumph !

The others look at her, see the weariness i n her face, try to

pump up the energy . But it's forced--

                    OCTAVIA

          The Girl on Fire!

                    FLAVIUS

          our little superstar !

They swarm over her -- hugging, air-kissing, examining . She

lets herself be caught up in their warm affection . Octavia

gives her the once-over, gasps.

                    OCTAVIA

          Oh, dear God--

                    KATNISS

          What's wrong?

                    OCTAVIA

          Your eyebrows! And you promised not

          to touch your hair ... and--

               ( yr: a1.,,. hei. hand)

          - - and what do you cut your nails

          with? A butcher kn i fe?!

                     FLAVIUS

          Leave her alone! Sweetie, we've

          missed you !

Katniss smiles, but Effie sees there's not a lot in it . She

knows what might cheer her up--

                    EFFI E

          Of course you've heard about Cinna ?

                       KATNISS

          What hapl?ened?

                    EFFIE

          What happened? You' r e his muse! Bow

          could you not know? He's a fashion

          God. Be's changed everything!

          Everyone wants to wear his c l othes!

                    CINNA (O .C.)

          Not everyone .

They turn as Cinna walks in. Katniss smiles warmly .



                                                                      14.





                     KATNISS

           Hey, Cinna.

                      CINNA

           Don't listen to these two. You look

           beautiful.

They embrace .

                          PRIM

            Katniss . . . ?

They all turn. Prim, shy, peaks in, holding Buttercup.

                      OCTAVIA

            Katniss? Is this your sister?!

Before she can answer, they're on Prim, Fawning .. . You're

adorable! I can see why you volunteered for her! Sweetie, I

could eat you with a spoon!

Prim basks in the attention. Cinna turns to Katniss.

                             CINNA

            You okay?

She hes i tates,     nuc.h:s. Ht:,   ~ L.utl lt:::~ h~L,   Lht:=u--



                              CINNA (CONT'D)

He tosses a 6undle of clothes at her feet .

                      CINNA (CONT'D)

            Time to go to work.

            ... And now the moment comes! Are

            they still together? Have they

            can true love survive outside the

            Arena? For all the details ...

INT . KATNISS ' S HOUSE - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

Crowded. Effie stands with Katniss just behind the front

door . Cinna helps Katnis s into a fur coat . The Pr ep Team

hovers, doing touch ups. The TV plays in a corner.

                       CAESAR (TV)

           .. . Let's go to District Twel ve as

           the star- crossed l overs embark on

           Day One of their Victory Tour!

          monster! Big smiles! Big smi les!

          We're happy and excited!



INT . /EXT . KATNISS'S HOUSE/ FRONT YARD - DUSK

Katniss pushes out her front door, into a blinding blaze of

TV light ing . A pair of drone-crane TV cameras glide in on

her . Caesar Flickerman's voice BOOMS over a P . A.

                     CAESAR (o . c.)

           And here she is: Katniss Everdeen!

Down the str eet, Peeta steps from his house, sees her . His

stylist, PORTIA, and her ASSISTANT stand off - camera.

                     CAESAR (O . C.) (CONT'D)

           And here he is : Peeta Mellarkl

                    '

Peeta sees Katn i ss and walks down the steps toward her . She

smiles and comes down her steps toward him . The CAMERA DRONES

glide along with her. Katniss throws her arms ar ound Peeta.

He sli ps and they fall over laughi ng.

                     CAESAR (O . C. ) (CONT'D)

           Whoa! Trouble in paradise!

Close on Katniss, she kisses Peeta. Peeta returns it .

PULL BACK TO REVEAL : THE ACTION IS HAPPENING ON A TV

                     CAESAR (V. O. ) (CONT'D)

           My goodness, look at them! What an

           utterly sweet moment!

Someone SHUTS IT OFF . And we see GALE REFLECTED IN THE

SCREEN . Conti nue pulling back to reveal we're inside :



                                                         16.





INT. GALE'S HOUSE - DUSK

On TV, Katniss kisses Peeta. Gale watches the TV, alone. He

looks away -- not able to bear it .



INT. CAPITOL STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

Caesar interviews Katniss and Peeta on a huge screen . Off the

pair, still lip-locked .. .

                     CAESAR

              (to audience)

          Well, I guess that answers our

          first question.

              (to Katniss and Peeta)

          So, Katniss? Peeta?

              {beat)

          Should we come back later?

Katniss and Peeta break apart, grinning happily at the

camera .

                    PEETA (TV)

          No, now's good .

                     KATNISS (TV)

          Sorry, Caesar .

They stand up, laughing and brushing the snow off each other .

                     ,CAESAR

          Don't be . This is your day. So .. .

          how are you two?

                    PEETA (TV)

          We're good.

                    CAESAR

          Come on, Peeta . Seriously, give us

          some details.

Katniss and Peeta exchange a l ook. Smile.

                    PEETA (TV)

          Things are great here in Twelve .

                    KATNISS (TV)

          Thanks to the generosity of the

          capitol, we've never been closer.

                    PEETA (TV)

          A hundred yards to be exact .



                                                          17.



Katniss bats him playfully . Canned LAUGHTER.



EXT. KATNISS'S HOUSE - DUSK

Katniss and Peeta hold hands and face blinding lights and the

unblinking gaze of the cameras . Caesar ' s voice BOOMS .

                      CAESAR (V. O. )

          Fantast ic ! We'll be checking in

          with you throughout the Victory

          Tour . Ladies and gentlemen, Katniss

          and Peeta!

We HEAR canned APPLAUSE through the PA . Katniss and Peeta

smile, kiss, and wave happily and the CAMERA DRONE tracks in

close . Effie is just off camera, pantomiming .

                     EFFIE

          Smiling ... smiling . . . we ' re happy

          and in love!

Film lights abruptly switch off . The camera drones droop .

Immediately, Effie turns , begins hustling the next move.

                     EFFIE (CONT'D)

          Al.l right, we •r e out of here in

          ten . Everybody in motion . We're on

          a schedule, my children!

               (as she exits )

          The train awaits!

         as the camera's off, the smile drops from Peeta's

face . Be turns, with strained politeness.

                    PEBTA

          Nice acting.

                      KATNISS

          You too .

                    PEETA

          Almost thought that kiss was real .

          But I made that mistake already.

He turns, walks off. She watches him go a s ...

                    EFFIE (V . O. )

          You two are so lucky ...



EXT. TRAIN - MORNING - ESTABLISHING SHOT

The train flies across the countryside.



                                                            18.



                    EFFIE (V ,O, )

          Fabulous food! Fabulous wine ... !



INT. TRAIN, DINING CAR - MORNING

Breakfast . Katniss, Peeta, Haymitcb, Effie and the Prep

Teams. Katniss is poking at her food. Haymitch is quietly

getting drunk. Effie is trying -- in her own way - - to convey

her pride and affection for Katniss and Peeta .

                     EFFIE

          Massages! Spa treatments! I said

          nothing but the best for my two

          vic tors! It all has to be just ...

Searches for the right word . Haymitch doesn't look up.

                      HAYMITCH

          Fabulous.

                     EFFIE

          Exactly! Now, t he schedule's a bit

          of a killer -- twelve days, twelve

          districts . But ... it's all parties,

          celebrations and adoring fans to

          greet you at every stop! Then we

          wrap it up in the Capitol!

Katniss looks up . Reminded of her visit with snow. Effie

misinterprets her apprehension ...

                    EFFIE (CONT'D)

          JUl you need to do is give a teeny

          little speech, wave to the crowds,

          and then sit back and enjoy your

          time in the spotlight. After all,

          you've earned it!

Katniss looks back at her incredulous .

                    KATNISS

          What did you say?

                      PEETA

          Katniss--

She holds up a hand, quieting him. Looks at Effie .

                    EFFIE

          I say enjoy your time in the

          spotlight! You earned it!



                                                           19.





                     KATNISS

           By killing people.

She turns, disgusted, and exits. The table is s hocked .

                     EFFIE

           Poor thing is j ust exhausted.



INT . TRAIN, CORRIDOR - MORNING

Katniss stalks through the train . She passes a doorway as a

Peacekeeper exits and walks past her . She stops .

Inside a compartment is the security center . Peacekeepers s i t

at banks of monitors . Some monitors show the train, but

others are l abeled "District 12", "District 11", etc .

Katniss stares. She's never seen a nything like this. Another

Peacekeeper notices her. The door slides shut.



INT. TRAIN, OBSERVATION DECK - MORNING

Katniss stands on the rear deck, which now rolls slowly

through green fields . She gazes at her Mockingjay pin, in her

hand, pute it away . A shadow steps next to hteL .

                      KATNISS

           I'm not i n the mood for a lec ture .

           I'll apologize to Eff ie later--

She turns . It's Peeta . They are awkward.

                     KATNISS (CONT ' D)

           I thought you were Haymit ch .

                       PEETA

           You don't owe anybody an apology.

                (then)

           Including me.

She looks at him.



                       PEETA (CONT• 0)

           It's not fair of me to hold you to

           t h ings you said in the Games . You

           saved our lives . I know that . But I

           can't go on like this: acting for

           the cameras, then i gnoring each

           other i n real life .

She nods . She can ' t either.



                                                           20 .





                      PEETA (CONT'D)

           So if you promise to quit looking

           at me like I'm so ... wounded, I

           promise to quit acting like it,

She smiles .

                      PEETA (CONT'D)

           Then maybe, just maybe, we could

           take a shot at just being friends .

She looks at him - - taken by his honesty and decency .

                       KATNISS

           I ' m not too good at friends,

                      PEETA

           For starters, it helps if you know

           each other .

               (off her look)

           I don't know anything about you

           other than you're stubborn and

           you're halfway decent with a bow .

                     KATNISS

               (smiles )

           Thdt obout eums me u p .



                      PEETA

           Not hardly . You just don't want to

           tell me anything .

                     KATNISS

           Like I said--

                      PEETA

                (moving right along)

           See, t he way the whole fiend thing

           works, fri e nds tell each other the,

           you know, the deep stuff ,

                      KATNISS

           Deep stuff? Uh oh. Like what?

                      PEETA

           Like .. . what's your favorite color?

                       KATNISS

           Now you ' ve stepped over the line .

They both s mile , A moment where they just look out . Then--

                      PEETA

           Seriously . What is i t?



                                                         21.





                     KATNISS

              (thinks, t hen)

          Green . Yours?

                     PEBTA

          Orange .

                     KATNISS

              (nods)

          Like Effie's hair.

                      PEETA

          Not that orange .

               (then)

          More ... like the sunset .

                     KATNI SS

          Okay . Green and Orange .

                       PEETA

          See. Wasn ' t so hard, was it?

She smiles. A HORN. The train slows. She sees something over

his shoulder. He turns . The train approaches gates that say

"Welcome to District 11".

                     KATNI SS

          Looks like we're here .

They go into a tunnel - - darkness broken by FLASHES of

electrical sparking . Katniss sees a flash of graffiti . The

Mockingjay symbol. Her head whips around.

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Did you see that?

                     PESTA

          What?

She can't say it . Shakes her head.

                     KATNISS

          Nothing.

They exit the tunnel . The District 11 side of the fence is

much more heavily armed and guarded -- multipl e gates, more

Peacekeepers, razor wire, machine guns, bunkers . It's a state

in lockdown -- martial law . Katniss catches her breath, turns

to Peeta. He returns her worried gaze . They've never seen

anything like t his.



                                                         22.





EXT . STATION, DISTRICT 11 - DAY

Peeta, Katniss Baymitch and the stylist Team get down from

the train. Empty platform. Instead of the cheering masses,

armed Peacekeepers hustle them i nto waiting cars .

                            EFFIE

                Not very festive at all, i s it?

                You ' d think we're all criminals!



EXT. DISTRICT 11 COUNTRYSIDE, MOTORCADE - DAY

A military motorcade speeds through a countrysi de of wheat

fields . Men, women and children in the fields, harvesting.

Behi nd them stand Peacekeepers with guns .

                          EFFIE (V.O . )

                             EFFIE

                . . . It's customary to offer a brief

                I'll do the talki ng, if you want .

I n a dilapidated room behind the Justice building, Cinna

joins Baymitch to watch on a Sound Man's monitor.



EXT . TOWN SQUARE, DISTRICT 11 - CONTINUOUS

Slow-motion footage of Thresh and Rue is ·projected on huge

screens around the Square. Katniss t a kes it in, keeping up

her front . Then she stops, almost falters .

POV -- Rue's family -- her Mother and Sisters -- sit in a

specially- roped area, draped with banners of Rue's face.

Thresh's Grandmother and other family sit in an adjacent

roped-off area, with banners s howing Thresh's face.

Katniss forces herself to smile. Peeta steps to the mic.

                      PEETA

          Thank you . We're honored to be with

          you today, and with the families of

          your fallen tributes .

She sees hirn quietly put aside the cards Effie gave him.

                     PEETA (CONT'D)

          And though they fought and lived

          honorably and with dignity to the

          very end, Thresh and Rue were so

          young . ..

The crowd begins nodding. Katniss sees Rue's family consoling

each other .



                                                             24.





                     PEETA (CONT'D)

           But our lives aren't just measured

           in years, but in the way we touch

           the lives of those around us. For

           me, and for Katniss, we both knew

           that without Rue and Thresh, we

           wouldn't be standing here today.

A MURMUR from the crowd - - moved by his generous words.

Katniss watches, impressed . Peeta presses on, quickly.

                      PEETA (CONT'D)

           In recognition o f that, and knowing

           that it can in no way make up for

           your loss, we wou l d like to donate

           one month of our wi nnings to the

           families of the two fallen Tributes

           every year, for the rest of our

           lives . Thank you .

He turns, leaves the podium. Surprise flickers through the

crowd . Then they APPLAUD, heartfelt and grateful .



INT . JUSTICE BUILDIN, BACK- STAGE - DAY

naymitch, worri ed, and Cinna, amused, watch the monitor .

                        RAYMITCH

         . Oh. Shit .

                     CINNA

           can he actual l y do that?

                      HAYMITCH

               (staring at the monitor}

           It doesn't matter .



EXT . JUSTICE BUILDING . DI SCTRICT ELEVEN . DAY

Peeta offers the microphone to Katniss who shakes her head .

There does n 't seem to be anything more to add. Then, she sees

Rue's SISTER, in the first row, staring at her with both hope

and reproach . She i s not applauding . The Mayor begins to

escort Katni ss and Peeta o f f stage . Instead, Katniss pulls

away and steps to the microphone .

                        KATNISS

           I . .. I just wanted to say: I didn't

           know Thresh. I only spoke to him

           one time , just long enough for him

           to spare my life .

                      (MORE)



                                                            25.



                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          He could have killed me, but

          instead, showed me mercy. That's a

          debt I can never repay.

Thresh's Grandmother looks up and smiles. Katniss turns .

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          I did know Rue.

She addresses Rue·s Sister directly . Rue's smiling face fills

the big screens around the square.

                       KATNISS (CONT'D)

          She was not just my ally . She

          was ...

               (a look at Peeta)

          She was my friend, and she will be

          with me the rest of my days. I see

          her in the flowers that grow in the

          meadow by my house. I hear her in

          the Mockingjay's song. I see her in

          my sister, Prim . She was so young,

          so gentle ...

               (tearing up)

          I 'm sorry . ..

And Katniss etope unable to continue. Silence . Then, in the

crowd, and OLD MAN whistles the four-note Mockingjay tune

that Rue used in the Arena .

And as one, everybody in the crowd presses the three middle

fingers of their left hand to their lips and extends them

towards her. The District Twelve salute.

Abruptly, a phalanx of Peacekeepers wades into the crowd. It

quickly turns chaotic . Everyone tries to flee . Some are

beaten. Children CRY. The crowd SCREAMS with fear. Katniss,

on stage, is horrified to see Peacekeepers grab the Old Man

who whistled and drag him forward.

                      KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Stop ... ! Please! Leave him alone!

A wall of Peacekeepers storm the stage, sealing it from the

crowd. Katniss and Peeta are hustled back-stage.

Katniss turns back, trying to see what is going on . She sees

the Old Man dragged up the steps onto the stage she just

occupied . Just as she is pulled through the French doors, a

Peacekeeper puts a pistol to the Old Man's head. Katniss

screams . The doors SLAM shut just as a SHOT rings out .



                                                         26 .





INT . JUSTICE BUILDING, ROOMS - DAY

It's chaos . Haymitch approaches Katniss, who looks up at him,

shaking.

                     KATNISS

          What d id I say? I was just trying

          to thank their fami lies.

Baymitch immediately pulls Katniss and Peeta's microphones

off their clothes.

                     BAYMITCB

          Stop talking . Follow me .

He leads them off. They f ollow as he stalks through one empty

room after another . He tosses their microphones aside . Up a

back staircase, through more dusty rooms . Finally, he shoves

open a door that looks as if it hasn't been opened in years

to reveal a ladder and trap door .



INT . JUSTICE BUILDING, ATTIC - DAY

They come through a door into a room filled with br oken

furniture, old books, neglected weapons and a thick layer of

dust. Baymitch shuts the door. Katniss is in shock, listens

to the chaos outside .

                     KATNISS

          The last t hing I wanted was to

          start a riot .

              (looks at them)

          He has to know that.

                     BAYMITCH

          What are you talking about? Who has

          to know that?

                     KATNISS

          Snow. He came to see me .

                     flAYMITCB

          Keep going .

                    KATNISS

          Be's worried about the Districts .

          He said they don't believe we're in

          love. They think I defied the

          Capitol and got away with it .

                     HAYMITCH

          so he wants you to make them

          believe it .



                                                          27 .





                    KATNISS

          To calm things down.

                    PEETA

          And I just made things worse ...

Be looks at her, angry now ...

                    PEETA (CONT'D)

          You know, it would've been good to

          know all of that before I opened my

          mouth and offered to give them the

          money--

                      KATNISS

           I'm sorry . I didn't know what to do

           - - Be threatened my family .

He turns, swipes a lamp off a table, sending it crashing.

                     PEETA

           I have a family too, all right?

           People I need to protect!

                    BAYMITCH

          What about them? Who protects them?

He points at the window, toward the square.

                    HAYMITCH (CONT "D)

          What were you thinking?

                     KATNISS

           I was thinking about Rue .

And that takes some of the air out of everyone's anger.

Haymitch stares out the window.

                     KATNISS (CONT ' D)

           Haymitch. Please. Just help me get

           through this trip .

He looks at her .

                      BAYMITCH

           This trip? Girl, wake up, this trip

           doesn't end when you get back home .

           This trip is going to last a

           lifetime. You don't ever get off

           this train .

Be comes away from the window.



                                                            28.





                     BAYMITCB (CONT'D)

          You two are mentors now. That means

          every year they• re going to drag

          you out and broadcast the de tail s

          of your romance. Every year, your

          private life becomes theirs. Your

          story's already been written. Just

          not by you.

They look back at Hayrnitch, can feel his pain in this speech

as much as the message he's trying to convey.

                    BAYMITCB (CONT'D)

          From now on, your job is to be a

          distraction so people forget what

          the real problems are.

The gravity of this hits them both . They share a glance.

                    !?BETA

          So what are we going to do?

Haymitch looks at them -- resigned , affectionate .

                    HAYMITCB

          You're going to smile . You're going

          to redd the carus Effie gives you .

          And you're going to live happily

          ever after.

Peeta looks at Katniss. She turns to the window, watches as

the Old Man's body is carried into an armored vehicle.

Okay. NOW Baymitch looks at her .

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          I mean, if l ike you said, we're on

          this train forever. It ' s going to

          happen eventually. Why not now?

                     BAYMITCB

              (thinks about it)

          It's a statement, I'll give you

          that.

                      KATNISS

          It makes it real.

               (adds)

          For the people.

                     HAYMITCH

          There's an engagement, a wedding,

          all of that rigmarole to distract

          people from the real problems .

              (then)

          Also protects both your families .

They turn to Peeta . He nods, says without emotion:

                     PEETA

          Sure. Why not .

              ( gets up)

          Let's do it .

And like that, he walks out of the car. Katniss watches him

go ...

                    KATNISS

          I thought that's what he wanted.

                    BAYMITCB

          Not like this.



EXT . TRAIN - SUNSET

The train WHOOSHES past BELOW us, and we TILT UP to see the

Capitol in the distance, framed by a setting sun.

                    CAESAR (V . O. )

          And just when we thought the

          excitement couldn't get higher . . .



                                                                34.





INT. STUDIO/TV SHOW

Caesar recaps an interview . Footage shows Peeta kneeling and

asking Katniss to marry him. In the footage, Caesar reacts

comically.

                       CAESAR (V .O.)

            ... The two lethal lovebirds from

            District Twelve surprised us all

            with a new twist in their story.



INT. MINER'S CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT

A few miners watch TV in the break room. Gale, at his locker,

stops, turns to watch . Can't hide his dismay .

                        CAESAR (V. O.)

            A fairy-tale ending to a star-

            crossed romance.



EXT. PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Effie leads Katniss and Peeta through the massive fat of

Snow's Mansion, an oasis in the heart of the city . They are

!urmt:t.lly dressed. Ceremonial. GUARDS l.l11e ·Lht:: UL.iv~.



                        CAESAR (V .O.)

           . And so tonight, a tour that began

             in the hollows of District 12 ends

             at the Presidential Estate.

Katniss stops -- she's never seen such opulence.

                        PEETA

            Cozy.



EXT. PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, TERRACE - r10MENTS LATER

They ascend a set of double stairs leading to a terrace.

There are fountains, gardens, flowers, butterflies . 30

projections of blooming white roses. Katniss gazes in wonder

as Effie chatters and pulls them fo=ard.

                      EFFIE

            Come, come! This is your night!

            Absolutely everyone's here! They're

            all dying to meet you!



                                                            35.





INT . PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

Decadence personified -- outrageous costumes and make- up;

champagne flowing. As they step i nto the main hall there is a

MURMUR of excitement. GUESTS turn, whisper while staring.

Effie waves, smiles and blows ki sses at familiar faces . She

speaks under her breath .

                       EFFIE

           They're a l l here, aren't they?

           Absolutely everyone.

Even she's taken aback by the showing. She looks back at

Katniss and Peeta, the two of them trying to maintain a sense

of di gnity ... something that even Effie recognizes is a

challenge . Katniss looks at her, as she's doing her own

"smiling" and "waving . "

                     KATNISS

           Bow are we doing?

                       EFFIE

               ( quiet)

           Don't worry about it .

               (lays a gentle hand on

                 J.<atniss· arm)

           You're doing fine.

Katniss can hear the change in Effie's voice, looks at her,

but Effi e's off, back into her own character ...

                     EFFIE (CONT'D)

           Hello! Hello! Look at you and your

           lovely self! So good to see you!



EXT. PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, BACK GARDEN - NIGHT

They exit into the back garden, set up with lanterns, a dance

floor, more WAITERS and GUESTS. Tables are piled high with

elaborat e food . Katniss and Peet a gawk, their mi nds ree l ing.

Katniss has never seen such excess .



EXT . PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, BACK GARDEN - LATER

The party is in high gear. Elegant music plays . Guests chat

and LAUGH . Katniss tri es to stay "up" but her smile i s

fading . Peeta is eating one bite after another of hors

d'oeuvres . Octavia hands him a plate of deli cacies .

                     OCTAVIA

           Try one of these. They're divine .



                                                         36.





                    PEETA

          I can't eat another thing.

                     FLAVIUS

          Bere .

He hands over a tiny stemmed wine glass filled with clear

liquid. Over the following, Katniss turns, sees Haymitch

chatting with Plutarch Heavensbee . They glance over, see her,

smile. She turns away .

                    PEETA

          What is this?

                      FLAVIUS

          It's for when you're full.

              (off his look)

          Seriously .

                    OCTAVIA

          It makes you sick. So you can go on

          eating.

                    FLAVIUS

          How else could you taste

          everything?

Peeta gently puts the tiny wine glass down.

                     PEETA

          ... Time for a dance . Katniss?

Be talces Katniss's hand and pulls her away.



EXT. PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, TERRACE - NIGHT

Peeta and Katniss join the dancing . An orchestra plays. The

Presidential Mansion looms behind them.

                     PEETA

          They're starving in Twelve . And

          here, they're throwing it up just

          to stuff more in .

                     EFFIE (O . C. )

          Katniss, ,,? Peeta,,,?

They turn. Effie is there with Plutarch.

                     EFFIE (CONT'D)

          I'd like you to meet Plutarch

          Beavensbee . Bead Game Maker .

          successor to Seneca crane .



                                                           37.





He bows first to Peeta.

                     PEETA

           That must be a hard act to follow .

Katniss elbows him . But Pluta;rch loves it .

                     PLUTARCH

           Leave him be, my dear, I take no

           offense.

               (to Peeta)

           May I?

                         PEETA

           Of course .

Peeta gives way to Plutarch who dances with Katniss .

                      PLUTARCH

           So . Bow do you like the party?

                      KATNISS

           It ·s a little overwhelmi ng.

                     PLUTARCH

           A little? Please. It's appalling .

           Still, if you abandon your moral

           judgment, it can be fun.

She stares . She's never heard anyone talk that way.

                     KATNISS

           So are you having fun?

                     PLUTARCH

           I'm Head Gamemaker . Fun is my job.

                     KATNISS

           Is that what happened to Seneca

           crane? Too much fun?

                       PLUTARCH

           Seneca decided to give up

           breathing .

                         KATNISS

           Decided?

                     PLUTARCH

           It was that or poison berries .

He smiles. Katniss blanches . He enjoys her discomfort .



                                                   38.



                      PLUTARCH (CONT ' D)

           Don't feel so bad . Head Gamemaker

           has never been the most secure j ob

           in the world ,

                    KATNISS

          Then why are you here?

                      PLUTARCH

          Sarne reason you are . I volunteered .

That stops her.

                      KATNISS

          Why?

                      PLUTARCH

          Ambition. The chance to make the

          games real ly mean something .

                    KATNISS

          I thought they were meant to scare

          us .

                     PLUTARCH

          To me, the games are art . A chance

          to create somethi ng beautiful . •

                      KATNISS

          ·People killing each other .

                     PLUTARCH

          Have you l ooked at much art?

                (then)

          Then again, maybe it was you who

          i nspi red me to come back .

Be looks at her . Is he serious?

                     PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

          Tell me, is there anything you'd

          like to do while you're here in the

          Capitol?

                    KATNISS

          No. Thank you ,

                     PLUTARCH

          Yo u find no amusement in our

          hedonistic little hell hole?

                      KATN I SS

          There ' s nothing I want here .



                                                            39.





Be stops danci ng, smiles at her with a strange sadness .

                     PLUTARCH

           Careful, my dear. Authenticity is

           as rare here as it is dangerous.

Abruptly, the MUSIC stops. LIGHTS dim . A HORN sounds. The

Anthem begins. Plutarch turns. On the mans ion's wall, footage

of white roses blooming is projected .

                       PLUTARCH (CONT 'D )

           Ahl   The Presidential welcome!

He takes out a poc ket watch. Opens it. Smiles.



                     PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

           Like all good things . ..

A Mockingjay image flickers on the watch face . Katniss is

unsure she saw anything .



                      PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

           ... it starts at Midnight.

Be snaps is shut . ..

                        PLUTARCH (CONT 'D )

           I'm sure we'll meet again.

He bows with a smile and departs, leaving her unsure of what

just happened. Peeta rejoins her.

                     PEETA

           What did he want?

                     l<ATNISS

               (watching him)

           I'm not sure .

She nods. Effie bustles in, grabbing them both.

                        EFFIE

           Come      yo u're the guests of honor!

Effies hustles them to a lit spot on the dance f loor .

Everyone CLAPS as Snow steps on the balcony, graciously

acknowledging the cheers. Katniss smiles and claps . Snow sees

Effie in the crowd, and nods to her . Effie waves back giddily

   thr illed .



As the Anthem ends, Snow's eyes find Katnise -- hopeful,

vulnerabl e ,



                                                             40 .





                      SNOW

           Tonight, on the last day of their

           Tour, I'd like to personally

           welcome the two Victors, two young

           peopl e who embody our ideal s of

           strength and val or -- and to off e r

           t hem my congr atulations on the

           announcement of their engagement .

Big CHEERS . Katniss and Peeta do an aw- shucks act -- smil ing,

blushing, waving. snow gazes down at her .

                         SNOW (CONT'D)

           Katn i s s , Peeta .. . Your love has

           i nspired us. And I know it will go

           on inspiring us . Every day . For the

           rest of your lives .

He r a i ses a glass to them. CHEERS . We see a quick glimpse of

blood in snow's champagne glass . Suddenly, FIREWORKS expl ode

overhead . Everyone turns and looks upward .

On Katniss . She turns back, l ooks up at Snow. His eyes are

upon her . Impercept ibly, he shakes his head ' no' at her . Her

face falls . She unders tands she can never escape .

SOUND FADES , I n this huge l avish assemblage of smiling,

cheering, prosperous people, she feels utterly alone .



INT. TRAIN, KATNISS'S CAR - NIGHT

Katnis s is wi de awake . She lies back to back with Peeta who

sleeps soundl y to the RAIN that flashes by. She quiet ly gets

up .. .



INT , TRAIN, CORRIDOR/ SECURITY CAR - NIGHT

Katniss pads down the hall . Ahead, NOISE from an open door .

She frowns, approaches . She peeks in .

Inside is the train ' s securi ty room. Peacekeepers are

gathered around monitors showing live footage from security

cams in all 12 Districts -- mos t ar e pl ac i d ,



EXT , DI STRI CTS (MONI TORS) - NIGHT

Monitors from a few Districts, however , show riots; tear gas ;

Molotov cocktai ls ; f ire hoses; angr y mobs; etc .



                                                           41.





on one screen, a wal l of Peacekeepers, s ilhouetted by fire,

marches toward a long young WOMAN who holds a sign over her

head. A single image -- the Mocking jay logo .



INT . TRAIN, CORRIDOR/ SECURITY CAR - NIGHT

Katniss stares, electrified. The revolution has begun. She

starts backing away . . .

                     SNOW (V . O. )

           She's not what they think .



INT . PRESIDENT SNOW'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Late. After the party. Snow watches t he same footage .

Plutarch steps into the doorway behind him . Without t urni ng

around .

                      SNOW (V.O,)

           she's not a l eader. She just wants

           t o save her own skin. Simple as

           that .

Plutarch slumps into a chair across from Snow.

                       PLUTARCH

            And s ince when is reality more

          . important than percept ion?

Snow does n' t answer, j ust s tares at the monitor.

                     SNOW

           A slow poison .

                      PLUTARCH

           Sir?

Snow t urns to him now .

                      SNOW

           We'll call it some kind of cancer.

           The capitol will take heroic steps

           to save her . But despite our best

           efforts, Katniss Everdeen succumbs .

           A tragedy. Her weeping husband by

           her side .

                      PLUTARCH

           Who would buy it. Not you, if you

           were watching .

                     PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

          I agree she should die, but in the

          r i ght wa y ... at the right time .

                     SNOW

          She knew what I wanted of her, And

          I made it very clear to her what

          the consequences would be if she

          failed to comply . This Presidency

          does not make empty threats .

                     PLUTARCH

          Sir, I don't care for politics.

          Affairs of State bore me to tears .

               (then)

          Moves and countermoves . That's what

          I live for. The angles . The way in

          a nd the way out . The Game . Winning

          the game . If I know anything, I

          know how to win .

snow sits there. Re's listening .

Plutarch watches as the young WOMAN holds up her Mockingjay

sign .

                     SNOW

          ~o what cto you propose?

                     PLUTARCH

         • Start by sowing a little fear .

                    SNOW

          But we're cracking down on the

          district even as you s peak .

                     PLUTARCH

          crack down harder . Shut down the

          black markets . Take away what

          l i ttle they have . Then double the

          number of floggings and executions .

          Put them on TV . Broadcast them

          live . sow a l i ttle fear .

                     SNOW

          It doesn't matter how afraid they

          ar e as long as she is still giving

          them hope .

                     PLUTARCH

          Katniss Everdeen is a symbol . They

          think she's one of 1.llfiln. We need to

          show she's one of.!!!! • We don't have

          to destroy her, just h e r ~- And

          t hen the people will do the rest.

EXT . TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

As Katniss steps off the train, Prim runs up to greet her .

Ber Mother walks up the platform, smiling . Prim j umps up and

hugs Katniss . Katniss hugs and whispers .

                       KATNISS

             Pack whatever you can. We're

             leaving .

Prim pulls back, stares . Katniss nods, determined .



EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY - LONG SSOT

FAR DOWN THE ROAD . Coming around the corner i s a shift of

soot- covered MINERS -- silent, weary, broken. Gale is one of

them .

PULLING BACK A BIT TO REVEAL KATNISS

Watching Gal e from this distance . Se listens absently as one

of the miners t e l ls a story. She sees how worn he is . But

still finds herself watching him. still feels glad to see

him.

The other miners l augh out loud. Gale smil es , looks this way,

and s t ops wal ki ng .



                                                              44 .



The ot he r miner s see her and grow quiet, noddi ng politely to

he r a s t hey pass. Gale now at the rear ... Katn i s s moving t o

They face each other a moment . Be's angry .

                       GALE

           When d i d you--

She hugs him close . Takes him by surprise . Then she says i nto

his c hes t, s o no one can s ee or hear ...



                     KATNISS

           we need to talk.



EXT. FENCE - DAY

Gale i s tense, wary . Katniss is qui et and dire c t .

                     GALE

           Run away? Where?

                       KATNISS

           Into the woods . Make a break for

           it . Li ke we talked about .



Be's not sure .

                      KATNISS (CONT'D)

           It we go r i ght now we can all be

           far away from here by tonight?

                     GALE

           Who's we? You, me and your f i ancee?

                       KATNISS

           Gale--

                       GALE

           --It 's a ll an act . I know. I know.

           You're just doing it to save you

           and Peeta .

                       KATNI SS

           Not j ust me and Peeta .

                (then)

           Pr esident Snow threatened to have

           you killed.

Be looks at her , nods like she j ust t old him what time it i s .

                     GALE

           Anyone else?



                                                           45 .



                     KATNISS

          Wel l, he didn't actual ly give me a

          copy of the lis t . But it 's a good

          guess it includes both our

          families .

                    GALE

          Unless what? You a nd Peeta get

          married?

                    KATNISS

          Unless nothing, now.

He looks back at her, takes in the meaning of that .

                      KATNISS (CONT ' D)

          Gale, we can do this . You said

          yourself you thought we could do

          it, the morning of the reapi ng .

               (then)

          What do you say now?

He stares back at her .

                     GALE

          I think it' s the dumbest idea I've

          ever heard .

               (smiles)

          But I 'll do i t .

                      KATNISS

          You will?

                      GALE

          Yeah . Let' s go and never come back!

She throws her arms around him, laughing a s he picks her up

and swings her around . Be puts her down and holds her,

touching foreheads . A moment , then--

                      GALE (CONT'D)

           I love you .



                      KATNISS

           I know .

ouch . She realizes how horribl e that sounds . He starts to

pul l away, she gr abs hold of him-- tries to fix it--

                     KATNI SS (CONT'D)

          I know ! And you know what you are

          to me !

Unconvinced, he pulls away .



                                                           46.





                      KATNISS {CONT'D)

           I 'm sorry-- I can't think about

           anyone that way right now. All I

           can think about every day, every

           waking minute since the reaping, is

           how afraid I am. There's no room

           for anything else.

                (moves to him)

           But if we could get away from here,

           somewhere safe, maybe I could be

           different.

                     GALE

           You ever think maybe the

           president's bluffing?

                     KATNISS

           He's not bluffing.

                     GALE

           You announced your wedding. He's

           planning it, I don't think he can

           afford to k ill you .

                     KATNISS

           I don't think he's putting much

           thought into my wedding right now.

           Not with uprisings in District 8.

She immediately regrets saying this . He is taken aback,

                     GALE

           What's going on in District 8?

She says notlling . He steps forward .

                     GALE (CONT'D)

           What did you see?

                     KATNISS

           I don't know. Probably nothing .

He waits. Knows there's more. She looks at him.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           People were in the streets. There

           were fires and the Peacekeepers

           were gunning people down, but the

           people were, . ,

                     GALE

           The people were what?



                                                         47.





                     KATNISS

              ( looks at him)

          They were fighting back.

He is electrified by the news. Looks back at the town.

                     GALE

          so it 's happening. Finally.

                    KATNISS

          If I'd just eaten those berries,

          none of this would've happened .

          Peeta could've come home and lived

          his life. Everyone would be safe.

He turns, incredulous, angry.

                    GALE

          Safe for what?! To starve? Work

          like slaves? Send their kids to the

          Reaping?

              (looks around, then)

          You haven't hurt people-- you've

          given them an opportunity. They

          just have to be brave enough to

          take it. There's already talk in

          the mines. People want to fight .

                      KATNISS

         . You' re not listening-- we have to

           leave~ before they kill us ... !

           All of us.

                    GALE

          And what about the other families?

          The ones who stay? What happens to

          them?

She says nothing to that. Be knows she has nothing to say. Be

keeps his voice.

                    GALE (CONT'D)

          People are looking to you, Katniss.

          You could do so much--

                    KATNISS

          --I don't want people looking to

          me! I can't help them!

They both turn as SOUNDS of heavy machinery rumble in the

distance. They duck down and watch the trees as an armada of

armored personnel carriers roll down the road to town . Once

it passes, Gale turns to her .



                                                           48.





                     GALE

           You do what you want . I'm staying.



EXT . SQUARE - DAY

Armored trucks roll into the square, drop their armor ed doors

with loud BOOMS . Helmeted Peacekeepers flood out with batons,

gas masks, and riot shields , and assemble.

A tall, severe man in a Bead Peacekeeper uniform, Thread,

steps out, l ooking pissed and ready to crack down. Cray, the

paunchy current Bead Peacekeeper, steps forward .

                    CRAY

          Commander Thread! Welcome to 121

Be offers a handshake . Thread ignores him, Peacekeepers swarm

Cray, slap a hood over his head, drag him off . Bis Deputies

They start to head back towards town.

   Inside, houses are ransacked. Cupboards yanked open.

Drawers pulled out onto the floor .

gear are thrown out windows and doors .

   The contraband is tossed into piles.

of contraband, sets it alight . It burns .

   Hooded ARRESTED CITIZENS are loaded into trucks .

EXT. /INT . HOB - DAY

Peacekeepers swarm out of an armored personnel carrier and

invade the Hob . Screaming and chaos as Peacekeepers drag

stall-holders out from their stalls, beat them and arrest

them. The stalls are a xed to pieces. Old women and children

are pushed around . Ripper tries to stop one of them, he

strikes her in the eye with the butt of his weapon ...

Peacekeepers with !lame-throwers set to work turning the Hob

i nto an inferno.



EXT. ROAD TO BOB - DAY

Katniss and Gale run along the r oad. They stop. The Hob is on

fire . She is horrified . He seethes .

stragglers are fleeing. Ripper is limping, blood on her face ,

hand over her eye . Gale and Katniss approach.

                     RIPPER

           Who is that? I can't see .

                      KATNISS

           It 's Katniss . I'll take you home .

He aims another kick at Gr easy Sae . Ga le sweeps his other leg

away . Thread falls and Gale punches him in the face .

                       GALE

           I ' 11 do that.

He lunges at Thread , but now Peacekeepers are a l l over him,

dragging him off Thread . Thread gets to his feet, f i ngers his

bloody nose .

                     THREAD

           In the square . I want an audience .



EXT , DISTRICT 12 BUILDI NG - DAY



Katniss sits Ripper on t he edge of a building next to a hand

pump . She wets a cloth and starts wiping Ripper ' s face when

we hear A WBIPCRACK followed by a distant SCREAM,

She turns . Sees people r unning a way f r om the squa.re ,



EXT , SQUARE - DAY

Snow is fa l ling heavily, A whi p CRACKS . A muff l ed YELL , A

crowd is gua.rded by a line of Peacekeepers. Katniss pushes

through the crowd . An old lady tries to stop her .

                      OLD LADY

           Get out of here, girl . You'll make

           it worse .

Katniss looks around, FACES staring back at her--

                     SOMEONE ELSE

           You want to get him ki lled?

Katn i ss shakes them off, pushes forwa.rd, breaks through the

Gale, tied to a post. Thread whips him. Gale's naked back

already a bloody mess. As Thread raises the whip for another

lash . ..

                       KATNISS

          Stop!

But Thread's already mid-stroke, Katniss already putting

herself between him and Gale. The snapping whip stings her

cheek and she goes down to her knees.

Thread is surprised. But determined. Be raises the whip

again . Katniss touches her cheek, gains her feet, and once

more steps between Thread and Gale .

                       THREAD

          Move--

                    KATNISS

          NO! Enough!

And without hes i tating he cracks the whip again, she turns

and takes the lash across the back . She keeps turned the pain

almost too much. A whisper:

                       GALE

          Katniss.

She opens her eyes, sees Gal e, head ducked, looking at her .

                         GALE (CONT'D)

          It's alright .

              ( t .h en)

          Go on.

She looks back at him. Be almost smiles at her. Encouraging

her . But instead of going, she slowly turns around and once

more faces Thread who raises the Whip.

                      KATNISS

              (qu ietly)

          Enough.

Be lifts his whip . She stands her ground .

Thread considers her a moment, now drops his whip, takes out

his gun . She stands defiant . He raises the gun--

A group of mi ners carry in Gale, lying on an old door . Prim

They lay Gale on the table. She glances at Haymitch.

Prim watches as her mother moves up beside her, tries to

prepare the syringe with the Morphling, her hand shakes . She

pauses . Prim puts a hand on her mother's .

                     PRIM

          There's not enough to waste.

              (smiles)

          I'll do ic .



Prim takes the syringe and expertly prepares it . Moves to

where Gale l ies--

                     PRIM (CONT'D)

           Bold him, please.

Baymitch and Katniss hold nim down as Prim injects him in the

neck, like she's done it a thousand times . Gale cries out,

arches his back for a moment, then settles--

                     PRIM (CONT 'D)

           He won't feel so much pain now.

Katniss looks at her sister, sees what she ' s become, finally

nods . She then sits beside Gale .



INT , KATNISS ' S HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT

Katniss sits alone with Gale, touching his unconscious face

forehead, cheeks, chin . On his back are two muslin c l oths

with snow in between . She leans, kisses him. He opens his

eyes, smiles weakly .

                     GALE

           Bey, Catnip.



                                                          55.



                       KATNISS

          Hey, Gale.

She strokes his hair.

                       GALE

          Thought you ' d be gone by now .

                     KATNISS

          I'm not going anywhere. I'm going

          to stay right here, cause all kinds

          of trouble .

He looks at her . Intimate, loving. Smiles again.



                       GALE

          Me too.



EXT . KATNISS'S HOUSE - DAWN - ESTABLISHING SHOT

One window lit in an otherwise dark neighborhood. Birds CHIRP

at the first light of dawn.



INT . KATNISS'S HOUSE STUDY - DAWN

Morning light . Peeta enters . Steps toward the study and

stops. Katniss sits with her back to him, alone with Gale,

str oking his hair .

Peeta•s heart sinks. She l oves Gale . He steps into the room.

Katniss turns.

                     PBETA

          Go to bed. I'll look after him .

Katniss gets up, exhausted, as Peeta takes her place.



EXT . KATNISS'S HOUSE - DAWN

Katniss is scooping snow into a large bowl . She pours a green

liquid into it, mixes i t with her hand. Prim comes out of the

house -- winter clothes on -- and approaches .

                       KATNISS

          Hey.

Prim arrives, hunches down, watches Katniss mix the snow.

                     PRIM

          How• s your eye?



                                                            56.





                    KATNISS

          It isn't my eye that's bothering

          me.

Katn i ss looks at Prim, shakes her head . Lowers her voi ce.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           Bow long can we live like thls? Bow

           long can anyone?

                       PRIM

           I t's not l iving.

                (then)

           But since the last games, something

           is different. I can see it.

                     KATNISS

           What do you see?

                      PRIM

           Hope.

Katniss reaches out, brushes Prim's hair back.

                     KATNISS

           You understand, whatever I do, it

           comes back to you and mom. And ·I

           don't want you to get hurt.

Prim absorbs that a moment, then ...

                      PRIM

           You saved my life . That has to mean

           something . You gave me a chance.

                     KATNISS

           Yes. To live.

                       PRIM

           No . To do something .

                (then)

           If you face them, we wi l l too .

                     KATNISS

           You're just a kid .

                     PRIM

           That's just how you see me. When

           you're gone, I take care of Mom. I

           take care of the sick when she

           can't .



                                                              58,





snow turns away, thinking . On the wall is an Audubon - like

print of a Jabber jay bird. He gestures to it.



                     SNOW (CONT'D)

          We created that Jabber jay as a

          weapon . An organic spy mutt . After

          the program was shut down an

          extermination order was i ssued but

          was carelessly executed . A few of

          them escaped; flew i nto the wild.

          Mated with Mockingbirds.

Snow t urns back to the VI DEO of Katniss.

                     SNOW (CONT'D)

          So now we have the Mockingjay - - a

          species that shouldn't exist, an

          offspring of our neglect that we

          can no l onger control ...

Snow stands up, faces Plutarch.

                       SNOW (CONT'D)

           I f you can 't contain Katniss

           Everdeen, then I will have to have

           her destroyed before she too is

           t Ldn~form~d and fli~e ueyontl o uL

           control.

                     PLUTARCH

           I understand that.

                      SNOW

           And not j us t her. Her entire

           species will have to be eradicated.

                     PLUTARCH

           Ber species, sir?

                     SNOW

           The other victors.

Be hits a button. The video continues -- Haymitch joins

Katniss in s tand i ng up to Thread. Then Peeta joi ns too.

                      SNOW (CONT'D)

           Because of her, they all now pose a

           threat . Because of her, they all

           now believe they're invincible.



                      PLUTARCH

           I f I may, sir, that 's what makes

           them victors .



                                                           59.





Snow pivots to a bank of monitors showing security cams in

a l l 12 Distri cts . Most are placi d , A few, however, show

protesters; tear gas; fire hoses; angry mobs; etc .. .

                      SNOW

           Whatever game you t hink you ' re

           pl aying, Heavensbee, they are not

           playing it with you . And I assure

           you a wedding is not going to be

           enough to prevent war!

                      PLUTARCH

           No, sir, I suppose it isn't , But

           you still can't simply eliminate

           her without consequence.

Plutarch walks and stares out the window. Hands fo l ded behind

his back .

                     SNOW

           I have no other choice .

Plutarch , thoughtful .

                       PLUTARCH

           There ' s a way we can sti ll wi n . A

           Wd Y   we can f irs t ruin her image,

           and then ki l l her without bl owback .

He smil e s now . Snow watche s skeptically .

                      PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

           It's what we gamernakers like to

           call ... a wrinkle .



INT . CAPITOL BUILDING, CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

Pl utarch walks down a cement corridor toward a heavily

fortified door . Two Guards stand at attent i on.

                      PRESIDENT SNOW (V . O.)

           Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens of

           Panem . This is the seventy-fifth

           year of the Hunger Garnes .

The LASER scans his retina . The door slides open .



INT . CAPITOL BUILDING, GAMES CHAMBER - AFTERNOON

The door shuts . The room is like a vault : spare, brutal,

Plutarch walks to a wall safe, puts his hand on a sensor.



                                                             60.





A green light . The door CLICKS . Inside is a small wooden box .

He takes it out. He places the box on a table.

                     PRESIDENT SNOW (V . O. )

          When the charter of the Games was

          written, i t dictated that every

          twenty- five years there would be a

          Quarter Quell .. .

He blows dust from the lid . Unlocks it with a small key .



EXT . AVE OF THE TRIBUTES PRESIDENTIAL ENCLOSURE - AFTERNOON

President Snow addresses a camera, under lights, all the

trappings of a state address (flags, guards) around him .

                       PRESIDENT SNOW

          ... To make fresh for each new

          generation the memory of those

          ki lled by the rebellion against the

          Capitol . ..



INT . KATNISS'S HOUSE - STUDY - AFTERNOON

Katniss, Prim and their Mother watch Snow on TV.



                      PRESIDENT SNOW (TV)

          ... The Quarter Quell was reserved

          f o r the Games of spec i al

          significance.



INT. PEETA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Peeta stands watching Snow on TV -- i ntent, concerned .

                      PRESI DENT SNOW (TV)

          on the 25th anniversary, each

          Di stri ct was made to vote on the

          Tributes who would represent it .



I NT . HAYMITCH'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Haymitch casually pours himself a drinnk as Snow speaks .

                     PRES I DENT SNOW (TV)

          on the 50th anniversary, as a

          reminder that two rebels died for

          every Capit ol citizen, each

          Di strict was required to send twice

          the Tributes to the arena.



                                                          61.





INT . CAPITOL BUILDING, GAMES CHAMBER - AFTERNOON

Plutarch sits at the table, opens the boy . Inside is a single

envelope, marked "3rd quarter Quell".

                     PRESIDENT SNOW (V . O. )

           And now, on the seventy-fifth

           anniversary of the rebellion, we

           honor our third Quarter Quell , as

           bestowed to us, by the signers of

           the Treaty of the Treason.

Be takes the envelope out of the box .

Opens it to reveal a small ornate card with i nstructions on

it. Re holds it over a candle and burns it .

Plutarch dips a quill in ink and begins to write on a new

card .



EXT . AVE OF THE TRIBUTES PRESIDENTI AL ENCLOSURE - AFTERNOON

The wood box is carried by a small boy, dressed in white,

onto the stage. Snow opens the lid and extracts the yellowed

envel ope marked "3rd Quarter Quell" . Makes a show of breaking

the 8eal. . Opens the envelope, reada .



                     PRESIDENT SNOW

           "As a reminder that even the

           strongest cannot overcome the power

           of the Capitol, on this 3rd Quarter

           Quell Games, the male and female

           tributes are to be reaped . .. "



INT . KATNISS'S ROUSE - STUDY - AFTERNOON

Katniss and her family watch, tense but distanced . On TV,

Snow frowns, feigning surprise, milking the moment .

                     PRES I DENT SNOW

           Are to be reaped from the existing

           pool of victors in each District .

Silence. Katniss•s Mother screams. Prim turns to Katniss who

stares blan kly at the screen .

                     PRIM

           What does he mean, "existing pool?"

Katniss doesn't answer . Is in shock.



                                                           62.





                    PRIM (CONT'D)

          They can't make you go back again,

          can they?

She puts a hand on Prim.

                     KATNISS

           It's alright .

She calmly gets up and wal ks out the door.

                           MOTHER

          Katn iss . . .



INT , HAYMITCH'S BOUSE - AFTERNOON

Baymitch stares quietl y at the set a moment, then explodes .

Roaring, he hurls a bottles at the TV, shattering it as ...



EXT . VICTOR'S VILLAGE, LAWNS - AFTERNOON

Katniss hurries away from the house . Ber Mother appears in

the door behind her .

                           MOTHER

           Katniss!

Katniss veers into shadows, not wanting to be consoled .



EXT . TREES BY VICTOR ' S VILLAGE - AFTERNOON

Katniss now runs , She makes her way deeper into the trees

until she can't see anymore and stops, not knowing where to

run to . An off-screen call:

                       MOTHER (O . S. )

           Katniss ... ! ! !

She drops to her knees then lies down in leaves, curling up

i n the fetal position . She balls up t he front of her shirt,

stuffs it in her mouth and SCREAMS .



EXT. TREES BY VICTOR'S VILLAGE - NIGHT

Katniss l i es alone, silent. Face streaked with tears . Wrung

out. Suddenly, she lifts her head . Whispers.

                           KATNI SS

           Peeta.



                                                                  63.





INT. BAYMITCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Katniss bursts in, tries to see in the dark . . .

                     BAYMITCB

           There she is.

She sees him sitting alone at his kitchen table, bottle in

hand, drunk. But not bitter or angry -- he's flying on an end-

of-the-world kind of euphoria ,

                          BAYMITCB (CONT'D)

           Finally did the math, huh?

               (as she walks up)

           And now you're here to what? Ask me

           to die . . . ?

                       KATN I SS

           No .

               (sits down)

           I'm here to drink .

Be laughs, shoves the bottle at her.

                     BAYMITCB

           Finally. Something I can help you

           wlth.



She s i ts down, t akes a few l ong s l ugs, ends up coughing .

                     BAYMITCB (CONT'D)

           So what's it say that Peeta was

           here 45 minutes ago, begging to

           save your life . And you only turn

           up now.

Katniss absorbs this . Almost a whisper.

                     KATNISS

           It means we have to save him.

                     BAYMITCH

           You could live a hundred lifetimes

           and not deserve that boy .

She nods. Everything has backfired ... all of her plans and

good intentions have led to ruin . She clutches the bottle.

                      KATNISS

           I don' t care about myself . All I've

           done's make things worse for

           everyone.



                                                           64 .





                    HAYMITCB

          You didn't make this happen .

                    KATNISS

          Come on Haymitch, nobody decent

          ever wins the games.

He almost smiles. She doesn't mean it as an insult, just the

truth. Be leans over, puts his hand over her s--

                    HAYMITCH

          You're wrong. Nobody wins the games

          period. There are survivors, but no

          winners.

They sit there a moment, these two survivors . She takes a

drink, l ooks back at him .



                     KATNISS

          Peeta has to survive .

              (then)

          Promise we'll save him.

He stares at her -- bruised, broken . Be nods tenderly .



                     BAYMITCH

          If they cal l hi5 name, I"l l

          volunteer in his place.

                     KATNISS

              (relieved)

          Baymitch. Thank y--

                    BAYMITCH

          But--

              (she tops)

          If they call Jl!Y name, and Peeta

          volunteers, there's nothing I can

          do.

                    KATNISS

          You can help him in the arena. The

          way you helped me.

                     BAYMITCH

          These games are going to be

          different.

                     KATNISS

          I don't care. Whatever you can do

          to save him.

              (then)

          Peeta lives, not me.

                     (MORE)



                                                         65.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D )

               (holds out her hand)

           Promise.

Be finally nods, shake : deal. She slumps, relieved. Then she

stands unsteadily, goes to the door, still holding the

bottle. She turns .

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           It'd be bad for you, wouldn't it?

           Knowing all the other victors?

Be reaches out, picks up a new bottle, cracks the seal ...

                     HAYMITCH

           Oh, I think we can count on it

           being unbearable wherever I am .

.. . And Drinks. She turns and exits .



EXT. MEADOW - DAY

Springtime . The sun is shining. Wildflowers in bloom. Katniss

and Gale sit in a meadow, heads bowed together. She finally

brushes his hair from his face, kisses him. Then stands up,

starts to walk away.

                      GALE

           Katniss?

She pauses, looks back at him .

                     GALE (CONT'D)

           We should have gone when you said.

She walks away, certain she will never see him again.



EXT, DISTRICT 12 STREETS - DAY

Citizens are shepherded by Peacekeepers into the Square .

Katniss, Peeta, and Baymitch walk together, united. People

make way . Gunslingers headed to a final showdown.

Katniss lets Peeta walk a bit ahead, catches Baymitch 's eye.

We've a deal, right? Haymitch nods -- don't worry.



EXT. SQUARE - DAY

A single slip of paper fluttering in a glass ball,

The Square is packed with sullen citizens . Peeta and Baymitch

are one side of the stage, Katniss, the other.



                                                           66.





Huge TVs have been mounted to show the proceedings. Effie, in

a gold wig, stands at the reaping ball, trying to ignore the

threatening edge to proceedings.

                    EFFIE

          And the female Tribute from

          District Twelve is :

She tries to catch the single slip of paper in the ball . It

el udes her . Nervous laughter from Effie . Finally she gets

hold of it. Pulls it out and reads it flatly .

                    EFFIE (CONT'D)

          Katniss Everdeen.

Not a flicker from the crowd . Effie looks to Katniss . Is that

sadness on Effie's face? Then she brightens and turns to the

crowd--

                       EFFIE (CONT'D)

          Wonderful!

Effie moves to the other ball. Picks out one of the two

pieces of paper fluttering inside . Katniss turns, looks at

Peeta, locks eyes with Baymitch. Be returns her gaze.

                      EFFIE (CONT'D)

          And the male Tribute from District

          Twelve is :

               (with relief)

          Baymi tch Abernathy ,

But Haymitch closes his eyes. Katniss is devastated as--

                    PEETA

          I volunteer .

He steps for ward. The truculent crowd is silent. Effie

glances at Haymitch, knows there's nothing she can do.

                    EFFIE

          Very well! The male Tribute for the

          Third Quarter Quell is Peeta

          Mellark. So, it just remains for me-

But her words are lost as every citizen in the square raises

their arms in the three f ingered salute. Bayrnitch, Peeta and

Katniss raise their arms in reply . Prim is there in the

crowd, this time stoic; proud,

A li ne of Peacekeepers deploy, separating them from t he

crowd. More Peacekeepers swoop in , march them off stage i nto

the Justice Building .



                                                         67.



The families of Katniss and Peeta surge forward, reaching

out, calling their names. The Peacekeepers block them.

Katniss tries to resist .

                    KATNISS

          Wait! I need to say goodbye!

                     THREAD

          New plan . straight to the train.

                    PRIM

          Katniss! Katnissl!l

Katniss turns. Prim pushes her way through the crowd. The

Peacekeepers stop her. They make eye contact ... Then Prim is

gone.



INT , TRAIN, OBSERVATION CAR - DAY

Katniss hurries into the observation car, looks back at the

receding town . In a few seconds, it's gone . She hangs her

head. It's the last time she'll ever see it .



EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

The train flashes through the darkness.

                    EFFIE (V.O.)

          I've had a thought ... !



INT . TRAIN, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Empty, except for a somber table of Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch.

Effie, in her gold wig, is trying to keep things up.

                    HAYMITCH

          You don't say .

                    EFFIE

          Katniss has her gold Mockingjay

          pin. I have my hair. I'm going to

          get you boys something gold.

They look at her, not sure what she means .

                      BAYMITCB

          What for?

                    EFFIE

          A token. Show them we're a team!

          That they can't ...



                                                          68 .





Abruptly, she chokes up. Katniss is surprised and moved by

this . Takes Effie's hand . Even Haymitch is humbled.

                    KATNISS

          Thank you, Effie .



EXT . CAPITOL - MORNING

Aerial shot - We soar down the Avenue of the Tributes toward

the gleaming new Tribute Center .

                     EFFIE (V .O.)

          It 's all different with the Quarter

          Quell this year ...



INT . TRIBUTES QUARTERS, ATRIUM - DAY

An elevator carries them up through a hole, ascending through

the atrium of the gleaming new Tributes Center.

          Center!



INT. TRIBUTES QUARTERS, ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Effie, Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch ride the elevator, gazing

in awe at the giant, Fasci st-architecture atrium .

INT . TRIBUTES QUARTERS, BALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Then your Gamemakers session so

INT. TRIBUTES QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

They enter their wildly voluptuous living quarters.



                                                           69.





                      EFFIE

          .. . And last but not least, the

          final television interview .

                (re: living quarters)

          Not bad, eh? Any questions?

Peeta raises his hand .

                     PEETA

          Yeah.

              (looks at Haymitch)

          Who's trying to kill us?



EXT. DISTRICT ONE SQUARE - LUXURY GOODS DISTRICT - DAY

A TV SCREEN shows the Reaping in District One. Gloss and

Cashmere, blond and beautiful, wave to a cheering crowd.

                     HAYMITCH (V . O. )

          Cashmere and Gloss . District one.

          Brother/s ister. Won back-to-back

          Games . Capitol favorites, lot of

          sponsors. They will be lethal.



EXT. DISTRICT TWO SQUARE - MASONRY/WEA.PONS DISTRICT - DAY



WIDER -- Kat niss and Peeta watch as Baymitch scrubs quickly

to a video file to the District 2 Reaping.

Brutus is Huge, scary, eager to get back into the Arena.

Enobaria smiles, revealing teeth sharpened into fangs.

                    HAYMITCB

          District Two . Brutus and Enobaria .

                    KATNISS

          What's with her teeth?

                     HAYMITCH

          Had them filed into fangs so she

          could rip people's throats out .

                    PEETA

              (staring at her)

          She's committed, I'll give her

          that.

                    HAYMITCB

          Also a lot of fun at parties.



                                                         71.





                     HAYMITCH

          One.

A young woman, ANNIE, goes into hysterics when her name is

called, but she is quickly replaced when an BO-year-old woman

with a cane, MAGS, volunteers, takes her place .

                    HAYMITCH {CONT'D)

          Mags volunteered for Annie. She was

          Finnick's mentor. Basically raised

          him. If he's trying to protect her

          in any way, it exposes him .

Haymitch watches as Finnick bends down to Mags, hugs her .

                    KATNISS

          Guy like that, he has to know she

          doesn't stand a chance.

              (watching him)

          I bet it comes down to i t, he

          doesn't protect her .

                    BAYMITCH

          I just hope whenever she goes, she

          goes quickly .



INT . CHARIOT STAGING AREA - DAY

Katniss exits an elevator door and the Chariot Staging Area.

She is already made up and wears a fitted black outfit .

She stops . This l ooks familiar: horses are being hitched to

chariots. The Tributes and Mentors stand in small groups

chatting. She looks for Peeta and Haymitch. They are not

there . She turns her attention to a nearby horse, stroking

bis neck, and talking to him like a confederate .

                     KATNISS

          Hey . Where'd we go wrong, huh?

                    FINNICK (O . C. )

          Hello, Katniss ...

She turns . Finnick steps up, disarmingly friendly, draped in

a golden net with a strategically placed knot. Be carries a

few sugar cubes ... pops one into his mouth.

                    KATNISS

          Bello, Finnick .

                    FINNICK

          Sugar cube?



                                                    72 ,





He holds out his hand, his palm piled with cubes.



                      FINNICK (CONT ' D)

          They 're supposed to be f or the

          horses, but who cares about them?

          They've got years to eat sugar.

          Whereas you and I ... well, if we

          see something sweet, we better grab

          it .

He smiles at her, that smi le .

                     KATN I SS

           No thanks, but I'd love to borrow

           your outfit sometime, though .

                      FINNICK

           Yeah , well, I've got to say, you're

           pretty terrifying in that get up.

           What happened to your pretty little-

           girl dresses?

                      KATNISS

           I outgrew them.

Runs his fingers through the fur on her collar .

                     FINN ICK

           You certainly did. Shame about this

           Quell thing . You could have made

           out like a bandit in the Capitol .

           Jewels, money, anything you wanted .



                     KATNISS

           I don't like jewels and I have more

           money than I need. What do you

           spend all your s on anyway, Finnick?

                     FINNICK

           Oh, I haven't dealt with anything

           as common as money in years.

                      KATNISS

           Then how do people pay you f or the

           pleasur e of your company?

Be leans in close, whispers.



                      FINNICK

           With secrets . What about you, Girl

           on Fire? Any secrets worth my t i me?



                                                             73 .





                     KATNISS

          I'm an open book. Everybody seems

          to know about my secrets before I

          know them myself .

He looks off, sees Peeta, in a matching outfit, approaching

with Cinna.

                     FINNICK

          Unfortunately, I think that's true.

              (then)

          sorry you had to cancel your

          wedding . I know how devastating

          that must be for you.

He tosses a cube in his mouth and saunters off . Unsettled,

she turns, sees Peeta now walking up .

                     PEETA

          Hey . What did he want?

                     KATNISS

          To know all my secrets.

                    PEETA

          Yeah, well. He's going to have to

          get in line.



Katniss and Peeta step up their chariot . Cinna places metal

half crowns on their heads .

                    CINNA

          Here. One last touch.

                    ANNOUCNER (V. O. )

          Prep Teams to leave the floor. All

          Prep Teams to leave the floor.

Cinna zips up the neck zipper on her jumpsuit. Quietly.

                     CINNA

          No waving and smiling this time.

          Look straight ahead. As if the

          audience a nd this whole event is

          beneath you .

                     KATNISS

          Finally, something I'll be good at .

Cinna grins , presses a small remote control in her hand .

                    CINNA

          When you're ready . Good luck .



                                                           74.



Cinna leaves. Trumpets. Tributes mount the i r chariots which

begin to glide forward. The crowd begins to ROAR ...



INT . CHARIOT STAGING AREA - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Katniss and Peeta's chari ot approaches the looming LIGHTS and

ROAR . She turns to him . Their eyes meet. Wordlessly, their

hands find each other, squeeze. STAY on them as . ..



EXT . AVENUE OF THE TRIBUTES - CITY CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

... Katn i ss and Peeta's chariot pulls out of the staging area

tunnel and the horses gallop past the ROARING crowds . They

stand together, united -- brave, stoic, aloof.



EXT . SKYBOX - DAY

caesar and Claudius watch as Katniss and Peeta enter.

                     CAESAR

          ... And final ly, from District

          TWelve, the couple everyone's

          talking about -- Katniss Ever deen

          and Peeta Nellark!

                     CLAUDIUS

          And I'll bet we see something

          special from their costumes,

          designed by super-stylist, Cinna .



EXT . AVENUE OF THE TRIBUTES - CITY CI RCLE - DAY

Katniss presses the remote in her hand. The outfits begin to

pulsate with dark red light, ebbing and flowing like hot

coals of a fi r e. The crowd ROARS their approval.

                     CAESAR (V.O.)

          And right you were, Claudius! Like

          glowing embers from the Coal

          District ! Unbelievable!

As each chariot gallops past the Presidential Enclosure, all

the Tributes turn and wave to President Snow as they thunder

past. Snow raises a hand to each in return . Katniss and

Peeta's chariot passes snow. Katniss looks straight ahead,

not acknowledging Snow . Pee t a sees this .

                         PEETA

           Katniss ...



                                                         75.



                    KATNISS

          What's he going to do, kill me?

Both Katniss and Peeta ignore Snow . Snow stops mid-wave.

Katniss steals a glance . Their eyes meet. She gives him a

defiant look. snow lowers his hand . Bis face sours .



EXT. CHARIOT STAGING AREA/ELEVATOR - DAY

The tunnel i s a chaos of dismounting Tributes and Stable

Hands grappling wi th horses. Everyone is buzzed. As Peeta and

Katniss's chariot stops, Haymitch i s waiting.

                     HAYMITCB

          Nice . Way to make friends out

          there .

                    KATNISS

          I learned from the best .

Chaff and Seeder approach.

                    HAYMITCB

          Katniss, meet Chaff and Seeder.

          Don't invite them over or they'll

          LiLluk Clll your llyuor.



Before Katniss can reply Chaff taker her bead in his hands

and kisses her o n the lips. Katniss recoils . Haymitch and

Chaff crack up .

                    HAYMITCH (CONT 'D )

          Come on. Let's get that make-up

          off.

He leads them into a nearby elevator. As the doors close, a

strikingly beautiful Tribute, Johanna Mason, slips in,

wearing a lumber- themed costume.



INT, ELEVATOR - DAY

Johanna yanks off her leafy headdress, throws it away . As she

talks she discards various accessories.

                     JOHANNA

          You guys l ook amazing . My stylist

          is such an idiot . District Seven --

          lumber, trees . I'd like to put my

          axe in his face .

              (turns to them)

          so what's it like knowing the whole

          world wants to sleep with you?



                                                             76 .



                    KATNISS

          I really don't think ...

                    JOHANNA

              (cutting in)

          I'm sorry, I was talking to him .

          Can you unzip?!

She turns her back to Peeta . Peeta politely pulls the zipper

down . Johanna -- freed -- shrugs out of her dress, letting i t

fall to the floor . They are startled . Ding! The doors open .

Johanna, naked, turns and grins.

                    JOHANNA (CONT'D)

          Thanks. Let's do this again some

          t ime.

She glances wickedly at Katniss, turns, walks off. They watch

her go, agog . As the doors close, Katniss elbows an open-

mouthed Peeta in the gut. Baymitch grins.

                    BAYMITCH

          Johanna Mason . District 7. Sharp

          tongue, sharper ax. Bey- -

              (nudges Peeta)

          Wake up .

Peeta slips out of his daydream . Haymitch points to him .

                    HAYMITCB (CONT'D)

          Don't be fooled.



INT . TRIBUTES QUARTERS - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Katniss and Peeta enter t he dining room. Haymitch, at the

bar, is pouring himself a glass of wine.

Displayed on the glass table top are digital dossiers --

background folders on each rival Tribute, with their names

and full-sized faces on each cover . They can be opened, re-

sized, and moved around by finger swipes.

                     HAYMITCH

          Ok, listen up : This isn't like last

          year. All of these Tributes know

          each other . You guys are the new

          kids .

                    PEETA

          What does that mean?

He joins them at t he table, taking a seat .



                                                         77.





                    HAYMITCH

          It means you've got to make

          friends.

                     KATNISS

          I'd rather just be with Peeta.

                     HAYMITCH

          That 's not enough . They 've seen you

          fight . They'll be coming after you.

          You're going to need at least a few

          others in your corner.

                    PBETA

          You want us in the pack?

                      HAYlUTCH

          Not necessarily. Choose who you

          li ke . All of them are killers . Make

          it known you're willing to team up.

          You're targets, but you're good

          allies -- popular with the

          audience, and you can fight.

                     KATNISS

              (looking around)

          How can we truat any of thoae •

          people?

              (looks at Haymitch)

          How can they trust .9.!l.?

                     HAYMITCB

          --It's not about trust, it's about

          staying alive.



INT. TRAINING CENTER - DAY

Katniss and Peeta enter the perimeter of the Center.

                     HAYMITCH (V.O . )

          ... so you need to find someone

          who's going to help you survive.

They look at the Tributes at various Stations. Unlike the

first games, the a tmosphere and attitude t his time is

different . Only a few Tributes are here, and those that are,

only a few actually bother to train .

                     KATNISS

          Where is everybody?



                                                              78.





They look to where a Tribute from District 5 slumps in a

c hair, holdi ng a l i quor bottl e. Be l eans over, vomits onto

the mat. Katniss l ooks away.

                      PEETA

           Not exactl y the same l evel of

           enthusiasm as last time.

                      KATNISS

           So far, I 'm not overwhelmed by our

           choices .

                      PEETA

           I guess j ust figure out who you

           trust least and work backwards from

           there.

Peeta departs, walki ng to the Spear Station, where Chaff and

Brutus are training . Katniss watches. Brutus throws a spear,

GRUNTING ferociously. It goes through A HUMAN-FORM HOLOGRAM,

taking its head off as well as the arm of another HUMAN-FORM

HOLOGRAM behind it. Peeta turns and looks at Katniss- - holy

shit.

Johanna, at a fighting station, swings her battle axe

ferociously. She sees Katniss watching and raises the axe

over her head . I t looke ae i f ehe ie about   to burl it r i ght

at Katniss ... But she sinks the axe i nto the mat and smiles.

                     JOHANNA

           Want to play?

Katniss nods to the men watching her ...

                       KATN:tSS

           Looks l i ke ther e's alr eady a line.

Johanna shrugs, turns to Gloss and the Trainers.

                     JOHANNA

           Boys? I'll be gentle.

Katniss goes to the knot station by herself, picks a rope.

Finnick comes up behind her, slides his arm around her.

                     FINNICK

           Here, Let me show you the best knot

           to know in the Arena.

Be takes her rope and quickly ties a complicated knot. Holds

i t up: a noose. Be slips it on, comically pretends to hang

himself, Katniss rolls her eyes, moves on.



                                                          79.





INT . SURVIVAL STATION - DAY

Peeta is being painted by a Morphling.

She is a thin, damaged individual, nervously giggling as she

paints Peeta's face with muds and berries .

Katniss watches them . Suddenly, the second Morphling flickers

into view, ••appearing" out of the wall of the station.

Katniss cracks a smile, and moves on ...

. . . She walks past the Tributes from District 3, Wiress and

Beetee, both mature and a little vague, who are trying and

failing to lig ht a tinder, striking flin t to steel. Katniss

stops to watch. Beetee sees her.

                    BEETEE

          The flint takes particles off the

          steel, exposing the iron which

          reacts to oxygen in the air,

          creating the necessary spark ...

He tries a few more times . Nothing .

                     KATNISS

           You just have to hit it harder.

She steps forward, takes the flint, with a quick strike

Poof -- she sets tinder alight. Wiress teases Beetee .

                     WIRESS

           A little brute force . . .

                      BEETEE

          .. . Is always helpful.

                (to Katniss)

          Thank you.

Then Wiress sees something over Beetee's shoulder. She nods

t o the balcony where the Game Designers watch. Plutarch

stands watching all the Tributes. Katniss turns.

                     WIRESS

           By the corner of the table .. .

                       KATNISS

           Plutarch?

Beetee turns and peers from behind his glasses. Plutarch

apparently looking at him. Beetee stares.

                     BEETEE

           A force field.



                                                         80.





Katniss turns and looks. She doesn't see anything.

                    KATNISS

          How can you tell?

                    BEETEE

          The shimmering. Top left hand side.

          You see it?

She looks . In a small spot, the air is rippling slightly.

                    WIRESS

          To separate us and them.

                    KATNISS

          Probably my fault. I shot an arrow

          at them last year .

They grin at this.

                     BEETEE

          It's electromagnetic.

                    KATNISS

          Bow can you tell?

                     BEETJ3E

          How can I tell?

He looks at Wiress. Smiling.

Wiress cracks up at Beetee. Katniss looks from one to the

other- -

                    KATNISS

          Is it obvious or something?

                    BEETEE

          Is it obvious!

                    WIRESS

          They might as well have a sign .. .

And now they're laughing again. Katniss grabs Beetee by the

shoulder and turns him back to her. He gets serious :

                    BEETEE

          Okay. Yes. see . . . the strength of

          an electromagnetic field is

          determined by the strength of the

          electric current flowing through

          it. The larger the current, the

          larger the force of the

          electromagnetic field ...



                                                           81.



                     KATNISS

          And so--

                      BEETEE

          Look around .

               ( she does)

          All of the holograms, the lights,

          every now and then, they all

          flicker . Why?

                     KATNISS

          Because the force field is taking

          up so much energy .

                    BEETEE

          Dead giveaway . But . ..

He looks around.

                      BEETEE (CONT'D)

          But there is a flaw :

               (leans close)

          Because we can see it, we know it

          i s there.

                (looks right at Katniss)

          There' s always a flaw in the

          system.

Katniss looks up at the Gallery where Plutarch stands, gazing

down at her. He smiles down at her, walks away .



INT . CAMOUFLAGE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Peeta is at a big sink, washing paint off his arms. She l eans

against the sink, looking out . He sees her .

                    PEETA

          So. Make any friends?

                     I<ATNISS

          I think they all may be just a

          little i nsane .

                     PEETA

          I think you'd have to be .

              (of f her smile)

          Keep looking .



INT , SWORD FIGHTING STATION/ FOOD SURVIAL STATION - DAY

Katniss circles past the sword fighting station, where

Enobaria is dueling an INSTRUCTOR .



                                                            82.





She attacks fiercely, backing him up, then knocks the sword

from his hand . Victorious, she puts her sword to his neck,

bares her teeth, HISSES.

She turns to the knife section. Cashmere is staring at her

with undisguised animosity . Next to her, gloss is throwing

knives into holographic human targets with great relish .

Katniss, unimpressed, turns, sees Mags, from District 4,

sitting alone at Food survival, tying fish hooks onto fishing

line . Mags sees her and smiles. Katniss approaches Mags, sits

down next to her .

                      KATNISS

          Hey ... I saw you volunteer for that

          girl. That was very brave .

Mags, smili ng, points at herself, shakes her head -- No.

Points at Katniss, nods -- Yes. Katniss understands .

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Prim's my sister.

Mags pats her hand. Katniss looks are her, charmed.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Listen, you teach me how to tie a

          fish hook, I'll teach you how to

          hunt. Deal?

Mags smiles at her -- appreciating the offer. Nods.



INT. ARCHERY STATION - LATER

Mags stands at a control panel. Katniss, a full quiver on her

back, threads an arrow and draws her bow ...

                    KATNISS

          Set it to a "10". Ready.

Mags turns a dial, gets a nod from Katniss, hits a button.

The WHINE of machinery getting into high gear. Abruptly, life-

sized holographic human targets begin rushing at her, bearing

weapons .

Pow, pow, pow, pow. Katniss hits them all.

More targets come from all direct ions -- jumping from

balconies, popping out from behind obstacles. Faster and

faster .



                                                           83 .





Pow, pow, pow, pow ... ! Katniss hits them all bullseye . It's

impressive. The t arget range machinery WHINES down to a

SILENCE. Katniss smiles, offers the bow to Mags.

                    KATNISS (CONT ' D)

          Okay, now you try.

Mags nods    look . Katniss turns . All the Tributes are

watching her silently -- jaws dropped, intimidated .



INT . TRIBUTES QUARTERS - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Katniss and Peeta are sitting down to dinner as Haymitch

enters and joins them, gr inning.

                     HAYMITCH

          Good news . At l east half the

          Tributes want you as an ally.

                    PEETA

          They saw her s hoot .

                     HAYMITCB

          Well, sweetheart, you got the pick

          of the littler .

Katn iss pushes forward the dossiers of Wi ress and Beetee .

                    KATNISS

          I like Wiress and Beetee .

              (off Peeta • s reaction;

               pointing to Haymitch)

          What?! You said they 're bri lli ant!

                    PEETA

          Johanna calls them "Nuts and

          Volts."

                     BAYMITCH

          Great . Anyone else?

                      KATNISS

                (hesitates , embarrassed)

           I like Mags .

Peeta rolls hi s eyes. Katni ss sees this .

                    KATNISS (CONT ' D)

          Okay, then no one!

                      HAYMITCH

           I'll tell them you're still making

           up your mi nd.



                                                          84.





INT . TRAINING CENTER, WAITING AREA - DAY

All of the Tributes are chatting and joking while they wait

for their personal training sessions . Katniss and Peeta sit

watching all the people they've gotten to know. Mags passes,

pats Katniss on the head . Katniss smiles, watches her walk

off, Turns back.

                     KATNISS

          Peeta ...

               (he looks over)

          ... How are we going to kill these

          people?

He looks at her, then looks down. He has no answer.



INT, TRAINING CENTER, WAITING AREA - DAY

LATER -- Katniss sits alone, stewing . Angry at the world.

                    ANNOUNCER (V . O. )

          Katniss Everdeen .

Katniss looks up, and heads to the Training floor.



INT, TRAINING CENTER - DAY

She enters as Peeta is exiting . They make eye contact . Be

gives her a half- smile. She enters the room and stops.

In the center of the room is a still-wet painting of Rue

lying in the bed of flowers Katniss laid for her. Katniss

stares at the painting, glances back at Peeta just as he

disappears from view . Back to the painting.

                    PLUTARCH

          Miss Everdeen ... ? Miss Everdeen.

Katniss turns around. The Gamemakers look down on her with

interest . Plutarch gazes down from on hi gh .

                    PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

          You have two minutes to present

          your chosen skill. You may begin .

Katniss looks up at him, an idea forming.

QUICK CUTS -- Katn i ss grabs paint , A rope . Goes to a dummy.

Paints a beard. Whips a noose around its neck. Throws the

rope over a beam. Pulls it up so it dangles , She turns and

flings the last paint up at the Garnemakers. It SIZZLES as it

hits the force field. She nods, polite.



                                                         85 ,





                        KATNISS

          Thank you ,

she leaves . on the dummy she has written "Seneca crane", The

other Gamemakers are horrified ... Except for Plutarch . He

watches her walk out, smiling.



EXT , TRIBUTES QUARTERS, ROOFTOP - SUNSET

The sun sets over a panoramic view of the Capitol . They sit

together in a beautiful rooftop, tense and worried , not

looking at each other.

                    PEETA

          Okay, that was probably not the

          best idea we've ever had.

                     KATNISS

           I'm glad I did it . You too .

                    PEETA

          Snow's not going to be happy--

                     KATNISS

          I don't care what Snow or--

               (gestur esJ

          --anyone in the capitol thinks, I'm

          not going to be a piece in their

          game.

A quiet moment , She looks off at the sky., ,

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Hey. Look at t hat. Your favorite

          color . Orange . "Like a sunset. "

He smiles at her, pleased she remembered,

                    PEETA

          Like a sunset ,

                    CAESAR (V, O. )

          Ladies and gentlemen . . ,



INT. CAPITOL AUDITORIUM - TV SHOW - NIGHT

Caesar stands before a vast Capitol studio audience.

                       CAESAR

           . , .The final night has arrived . , ,



                                                          87.





INT . CAPITOL AUDITORIUM - TV SHOW - NIGHT -- JUMP CUTS

Beetee, academic, challenges the Quel l's legitimacy.

                    BEETEE

          If the Quell has been written by

          men, surely it can be unwritten .

Johanna is impassioned.

                      JOHANNA

          The signers of the Treaty of

          Treason would neve r l et th i s

          stand . . .

Seeder is quiet and dignified .



                    SEEDER

          If President Snow is so powerful,

          why can't he change the Quell?

Chaff is angry, confrontational.

                    CHAFF

          He could change it if he wanted . So

          he must not want to .



INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Katniss watches the TV as the studio audience APPLAUDS

Chaff's provocation. Cinna finis hes touching her up .

                     CINNA

          Okay, done .

Angle - - Katniss stands in a beautiful wedding dress.

                    KATNISS

          Will I be twirling this year?

                    CINNA

          Save it for the end .

They s hare a smile. Effie sticks her head in .

                     EFFIE

          One minute . Is she ready?

Effie sees Katniss in her dress and reacts, emotional .

                     EFFIE (CONT' D)

          Oh , my dear . .. 1 You would have been

          the most beautiful bride!



                                                                   88 .





She chokes up. Katniss goes and hugs her. Effie wipes her

tears.



                      EFFIE (CONT 'D)

            Come on. Let 's show them what real

            beauty looks like .



INT. CAPITOL AUDITORIUM - TV SHOW - NIGHT

Effie leads Katniss to the stage wings . The Tributes sit side-

by- side on stage as Caesar prattles on . Johanna is in the

wings, dress being repaired by her Stylist .

                      JOHANNA

            Really? A wedding dress? Just how

            much attention do you need?

                      l<ATNISS

            Snow made me wear it .

Johanna's face shows pity, then empathy, then defiance.

                      JOHANNA

            Make him pay for it .

A g~nulue timlle b~Lwe~n Lh~m . Cd.~H~r lulru<.lut;~::s   ht:H.•

            ... Last year ' s victor from District

            Twelve, Katniss Everdeen ... !

We FOLLOW Katniss as she walks out into the lights.

Big APPLAUSE . Katniss sees the other Tributes staring at her

dress. Caesar kisses her cheek. She takes a seat.

                       CAESAR (CONT'D)

            You l ook fabulous! Doesn't she?

Audience APPLAUSE. Caesar goes into solemn, ultra- unctuous

mode. Leans in, fake-intimmate , fake-emotional .

                      CAESAR (CONT'D)

            Now, Katniss. This i s obviously an

            emotional night for all of us ...

                      KATNISS

            Don't start crying on me, Caesar.

Big LAUGH. Caesar plays along, laughing at himself .

                      CAESAR

            I can't make any promises.



                                                         89 .





                      KATNISS

          I wouldn't believe you anyway.

Huge LAUGH. Even Caesar loves it. As things settl e down, he

turns to the audience :

                    CAESAR

          And we were so looking forward to

          your wedding . Weren't we, folks?

APPLAUSE and CRIES of sympathy. She nods graciously.

                     CAESAR (CONT'D)

          Alas . And this is the dress you

          would have worn?

                      KATNISS

          President Snow thought everyone

          would want to see it .

APPLAUSE. Yes! Yes!

                     CAESAR

          would you .. . ?

He gestures to the floor . Katniss smiles to herself. Gets to

her feet. Locke out, finde cinna in the crowd. Eye contact.

Does a twirl and then another . As she spins, the dress begins

to smoke and then catch fire. Screams from the audience .

Katniss is surprised. She glimpses Cinna nodding at her,

encouragi ng her on.

Katniss keeps spinning as the dress burns high then gradually

comes to a halt. She is surrounded by a circle of smoldering

ashes . The white wedding dress has burnt away to reveal a

black, fitted dress . APPLAUSE. Then Katniss lifts her dress

arms, revealing ... A bird outline in silhouette. Black.

Sleek. Feathered. Jay-like streaks of white on the sleeve

"wings".

                    CAESAR ( CONT'D)

          Oh, my! Feathers! Like a bird!

          Like ...

                      KATNISS

          A mockingjay.

A defiant smile . Big APPLAUSE from the audience .



INT. PRESIDENT SNOW'S QUARTERS, DEN - NIGHT

                    CAESAR

          Your stylist has surpassed himself.

          What theatricality! Cinna, a bow.

On TV, the camera zooms in on Cinna who nods modestly.

                    CAESAR (V. O. } (CONT'D)

          In a cruel twist of fate ...



INT. CAPITOL AUDITORIUM - TV SHOW - MINUTES LATER

Peeta is the last interview. Wearing a tux, he shares his

stoic anguish with a sol emn, melodramatic Caesar.

                     CAESAR

          ... Your love with Katniss. Now cut

          tragically short .

                    PEETA

          Caesar, we had a year together. A

          year I wouldn't trade for anything.

                    CAESAR

          And the wedding .. . Never to be.

                     PEETA

          No, we . .. We got married . In

          secret. We wanted our union to be

          eternal.

Caesar puts his hand on Peeta's, eyes fi lling wi th tears .

Peeta shakes his head -- humble, noble, stoic, tragic ...

                      PEETA (CONT' D)

          I don't mind dyi ng. Katniss and I

          have been luckier than most. I'd

          have no regrets at all if it

          weren • t for ...

He falters, overcome. HUSHED . Not a dry eye in t he house.

Everyone leans forward to hear     even Katniss .

                    CAESAR

          Weren't for what?

                      PEETA

           I f it weren't for the baby!

He bows his head. SCREAMS . Chaos in the audience. Katniss is

shocked. Caesar is tal king, but can't be heard over the

HUBBUB of the crowd.



                                                           91.





                    CAESAR

          Ladies and gentlemen, the Tributes

          of the Third Quarter Quell .. . !

Peeta goes to Katniss, hugs her . The ANTHEM begins. She turns

faces the crowd, holding Peeta's hand. In the crowd,

Haymitch offers a "bravo" gesture to Peeta . Nicely played.

Then Katniss takes Chaff's hand. Spontaneously, all Tributes

grab hands in a show of solidarity .

The audience is stunned . Finnick raises his arms over his

head. They all follow -- united, defiant, triumphant. The

crowd goes CRAZY, Caesar is rendered speechless. There are

CRIES and CALLS from a few in the audience .

                    CROWD

          cancel! stop it! cancel the Games!

          Call them off! Cancel!!!

Abruptly, the in-studio monitors cut to static, and the house

LIGHTS go dark.



INT, TRIBUTES QUARTERS - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Peeta is at the windows, looking down into the streets .

Katniaa aita apart, pensive, clutching a -pillow.



                    PEETA

          They're going crazy down there.

POV -- In the street a huge cro~d is chanting, scuffling .

                    KATNISS

          They won't cancel . They can't .

She turns to Peeta. Be feels her looking at him.

                     PEETA

          What?

                    KATNISS

          We got married?

                     PEETA

          Apparently .

                    KATNISS

          And I'm pregnant?

                    PEETA

          You look great--



                                                           92 .





                       KATNISS

          --Peeta.

                     PEETA

          Sorry . Once I got started, I

          couldn't stop.

                    KATNISS

          Next time, maybe a little heads up?

                    PEETA

          I can do that .

They share a smile when Baymitch enters, with Effie . Katniss

and Peeta turn . He shakes his head.

                       HAYMITCB

          Still on .

They absorb this, nod. A pause -- this is goodbye.

                    BAYMITCB (CONT'D)

          Listen, it's a Quarter Quell year.

          There's usually a theme, Look for

          an underlying pattern.

They nod . Effie 9tep9 forwdrd.



                    EFFIE

          I have something for you boys.

She hands Peeta and Haymitch small clamshell jewel cases.

Peeta and Haymitch, f rown, open them. Peeta's contains a

small gold medallion . Haymitch lifts out a go l d bangle.

                     HAYMITCH

          What's this?

                    EFFIE

          Your token, remember? Hair for me.

          Pin for Katniss . Bangle for you.

          For Peeta: the medallion we talked

          about.

She smiles at Peeta who nods . She looks at all of them.

                       EFFIE (CONT'D)

          We're a team, aren't we?



                    PEETA

          Thank you, Effie.

She smiles, but her eyes grow misty . She goes and hugs Peeta,

then Katniss .



                                                             93.





                    EFFIE

          I want you to know I'm proud of my

          Victors. That you both look so--

She stops . Enough cheerleading. She says what she feels :

                      EFFIE (CONT'D)

          You both deserved much better.

               (then)

          I 'm sorry.

She lifts a handkerchief to her face . Choking back a

meltdown, she turns with great dig nity and departs . Haymitch

nods to them, and turns to follow her.

                     PEETA

          Haymitch.

              (he turns)

          Thanks . For everything .

Haymitch nods, this is hard for him .

                    KATNISS

          Any last advice?

                     HAYMITCB

          3tay alive .



She goes, hugs him. He's surprised until she whispers ...

                    KATNISS

          Remember our deal ...

Raymitch nods, tries to pull away, but she hangs on--

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Do whatever you can to save him.

Re pulls back, looks at her, nods . They smile. He turns to

the door, then stops , turns back.

                     HAYMITCH

          Katniss . When you're in the Arena,

          remember who the real enemy is .

He smiles, turns, and is gone .

Katniss and Peeta lie toge t her, dressed, watching the sun

                     KATNISS

           That's what I want .

A KNOCK on the door . They look at the door, then each other .

He strokes her hair .

                      PEETA

She nods. Re gets up .

Plutarch stands before a set of monitors showing the Tributes

holding hands . Snow steps up behind him.

                     PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

          They may be holding hands now ...

          But t he minute the gun goes off, it

          will be a bloodbath. The whole idea

          of revolution will be discredited.

Snow pivots to another bank of monitors showi ng each Tribute

their pods. His e yes f i nd Katn iss with Cinna, braiding her

ha ir.

                    SNOW

          What about the idea of her?

                    PLUTARCH

              (watching the screen)

          The more allies she betrays, t he

          more friends she kills , and the

          more she reveals her t rue self ...

          she becomes j ust ano ther member of

INT . PREP CHAMBER - POD - DAY

Katniss, nervous , hair brai ded, is standing in a skin-tight

j umpsuit . Cinna is inspe cting t he fabric .

                       CINNA

          I t 's light . No thermal. I'd guess

          desert or tropi cs .



                                                          96.





                    INTERCOM (V. O. )

          One minute to launch. One minute.

They look at each other . Katniss thinks she will never see

him again . she becomes emotional.

                    KATNISS

          Thank you for the dress ...

                    CINNA

          Thought you'd like it .

                        KATNISS

          Cinna . ..

She falters, overcome . He is calm and soothing .

                        CINNA

          Shhhhh .. .

He touches her lip, quieting her . He takes out her gold

Mockingjay pin, fixes i t to her suit . Zips up the neck of her

jumpsuit securely.

                    CINNA (CONT'D)

          Remember, girl on fire. I'm still

          betting on you.

He kisses her forehead, steps back as the glass cylinder

slides down around her. They are inches apart. Katniss puts a

hand on the glass. Cinna puts hie hand over hers.

                    INTERCOM (V. O. )

          Ten seconds.

Abruptly, two Peacekeepers burst into the room. One grabs

Cinna's head and smashes it repeatedly against the glass .

Cinna falls to the floor. Kicked . Blood smears the glass . She

bangs against the sound-proof glass, screams silently as

Cinna's unconscious body is dragged out of the room.

                     INTERCOM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          ... five, four, three, two, one .

          Launch.



INT. POD - DAY

We are with the screaming Katniss , And then with a whoosh,

black and finally . . .



                                                            97.





EXT. ARENA, WATER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Silence . Katniss looks around -- shaken, crying . She ' s on the

small disc, surrounded by water . Above her, pink sky and

golden sun. A 3D hologram counts down 10, 9 . ..

A center island holds the Cornucopia . Spokes of sand radiate

out from the island i nto a surrounding jungle . Distantly,

other Tri butes are similarly stranded.

She stops sobbing . Bends, tests the water with a finger.

Tastes it. Makes a face, spits it out . Salty .

                      CLAUDI US

           Let t he 75th Hunger Games beginl

The GONG sounds . Katniss dives . swims for her life .



EXT , CORNUCOPIA - DAY

She reaches the sand spoke, scrambles out of the water . She

stops -- most of the other tributes are still stuck on their

discs . Katniss sprints toward the Cornucopia.

She gets to the cornucopia, grabs a bow and a quiver of

arrows. Arms the bow .



                          FINNICK

           Katniss .. .

Katniss swings around to see Finnick holding a trident . She

draws the stri ng, ready to shoot .

                     FINNICK (CONT'D)

           The idea is to kill your enemies .

               (holds the trident to his

                chest)

           Not your allies.

He holds his trident so that sun GLINTS off something on his

wrist . Haymitch's bangle .

                       KATNISS

           Where ' d you get t hat?!

                     FINNICK

           Where d'you think?

Before Katniss can a nswer, FOOTSTEPS approach behind her .

                          FINNICK (CONT'D)

           Duck!!



                                                         98.





She hits the sand as Finnick's trident flies over her head.

The alcoholic Tribute from District 5 takes the trident full

in the chest. He sinks to hi s knees, drops both swords in his

hands, falls over onto the beach . Finnick goes to pull the

trident out of the dead body.

                    PINNICK (CONT'D)

          Don't trust One and Two. I'll take

          this side. You hold them off! GO!

He di sappears around the cornucopia . Other Tributes stalk

closer along the sand spokes. Katniss lets f ly an arrow at

Enobaria who dives back into the water. Gloss is also coming.

Katniss fires an arrow that gets him in the calf . He falls

backward. Pinnick reappears.

                    FINNICK (CONT'D)

          It's all weapons . Grab what you can

          and let's get out of here.

They rifle through the pile of weapons . Katniss grabs another

quiver of arrows , Brutus comes charging at them, ROARING

bloodthirstily. Finni ck barely l ooks up.

                     FINNI CK (CONT'D)

          Oh, subtle . Take care of that, will

          you?



Katniss fires an arrow. He holds up the belt as a shield,

take the arrow in it. She loads the bow for another shot but

he retreats. Pinnick is armed up. Other Tributes are

converging along other spokes toward the Cornucopia.

                      FINNICK (CONT'D)

          Come on!

Pinnick and Katniss sprint along a spoke to the shore . They

see Peeta in the water fending off a Tribut e. Katniss aims

her bow, can't get a shot, her vi ew i s blocked by Peeta's

disk.

                     PINNICK (CONT'D )

          I 'll give him a hand.

                    KATNISS

          No-- I'll do it.

                    FINNICK

          Not in your condit ion.

                      KATNISS

          My what--

He stops, patting her stomach.



                                                             99.



                     FINNICK

           Keep the rest at bay. I'll be right

           back .

He dives in the water. Katniss scans the beach. Now that

she's left the Cornucopia, other Tributes flood in . The

Career Pack forms -- Gloss, Cashmere, Brutus and Enobaria

band together. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting starts. Two

figures fall. The cannon BOOMS twice.

Katniss trains her bow on Finnick as she moves smoothly

through the water. She could kill him. She moves the sights

to the dis k, where Peeta fights with the tr i bute . She sti ll

can't get a shot . Suddenly the splashing stops. A cannon

BOOMS. A beat, and Peeta swims around toward Katniss. He's

ok ...

Katniss looks out to sea. Mags splashes toward her . A distant

Tribute is moving down the sand toward her, axe raised to

kill. Katniss looses an arrow.

A CRY as the Tribute goes down . Finnick and Peeta are now

swimming smoothly through the water .

They reach the shore. Peeta runs to Katniss as Finnick turns

to see Mags coming ashore.

                     PEETA

           Guess we're not going to be alone.

                      KATNISS

           Like it o r not.

                      PEETA

           Anyone else?

                     KATNISS

           What about Mage?

                     FINNICK

           Not leaving her. She's one of two

           people in the world who actually

           likes me.

He runs, scoops up the older woman, puts her on his back,

                       FINNICK (CONT'D)

           Let's go.

They set of running toward the jungle .

                     KATNISS

           I thought everyone liked Finnick

           Odair .



                                                           100.





                         FI NN I CK

             That ' s a diff er ent kind of like,

             darling.



EXT . JUNGLE - DAY

They enter the jungle running pel l rnell , just t r ying to get

away . It's lush, heavy . Peeta takes the lead, using a sword

to hack through . A steep hill begins upward. They start

climbing, breathing hard, sweating alr eady .

                       FINNI CK

             Go, go, go! Get up high!



EXT. JUNGLE, CLEARING - DAY - MINUTES LATER

They scramble the hill in single file, exhausted, Peeta

slashing through the thick undergrowth . Finnick f oll ows, hand

on his trident, carrying Mags . Katniss last, her bow ready .

They're out of breath, about to collapse .

                       FINNICK

             Okay, hold up! Hold up!

                   then collapses, GASPING for air . Peeta

Ht< puL,; down Mag ,; ,

sits down hard, recovering, looking arou.n d. The jungle is

thick, lush, strange -- fu l l of colorf ul f l owers, giant

ferns, parrots and other NOI SY bir ds .

                        PEETA

             God, i t's hot! We've got to find

             fresh water.

                       FINNICK

             At least we have a head start. Hal f

             the tributes can't swim.

Suddenly, two BOOMS come from the can non .

                        FINNICK (CONT'D)

             I guess they aren't holding hands

             anymore . It's certainly no place

             for a woman in your condition .

She turns, gives him a scowl .

                       KATNISS

             You think it's funny?

                        FINNICK

             Bey, every time that cannon goes

             off it 's music to my ears .



                                                            101.





She threads and arrow in her bow.

                      KATNISS

           Good to know .

seei ng t his, he lifts his t rident, ready . Their eyes meet .

                     FINNICK

           You want to face the Career Pack

           alone? What would Baymitch say?

                     KATNISS

           Baymitch isn't here .

As she starts to l i ft her bow, Peeta steps between them .

                     PEETA

           Let's keep moving and find some

           water .

A long beat . Finnick gives her an admonishing gri n, shakes

his bangle at her .

She lowers her bow.

                        KATNISS

           I ' m 110L yu l ug l.Jt:tck dowu Lh~r~ . •

           Maybe there's water on the other

           side of this hill.

                     FINNICK

           Okay. Mags?

She is looking weary, but nods .

                         FINNICK (CONT'D)

           come on .

And he heaves Mags onto his back again. They set off .



EXT . JUNGLE - DAY

The four wal k in s i ngle fi l e, Peeta in the lead, cutting

through the jungl e. The top of t he hi l l seems near .

                      PEETA

           Anyone tracking us? Katniss?

She t urns, looks back. No one's foll owi ng them. Katniss turns

back to Peeta. In the sky ahead, something wavering, perhaps

a heat shimmer . She looks c l osely ...



                                                          102.





                         KATNISS

          Peeta .. . !



Peeta keeps walking, swinging his knife. He half-turns.

                         PEETA

          Yeah?

A FLASH and a sparking NOISE -- FWOOM . For a second, we see

the workings of the Arena -- hydraulics, scaffolding, wires

and beyond it, a dry prairie landscape .

Peeta flies back, smashes Katniss, sends her sprawling. His

clothes are smoking slightly . She crawl s over to him. Puts

her face against his lips .

                       KATNISS

          Peeta .. . ? Peeta?!ll He's not

          breathing!

Suddenly, she is pushed off and Finnick sits on top of Peeta

and holds his nostrils closed.

                         KATNISS (CONT'D)

          NO!

st1e wlllp" an arrow i nto her bow, ctirns, t ll"'n freezes .

Strangely, Finnick is kissing Peeta . Or blowing air into his

lungs . Then, Finni c k's f ist pounds Peeta•s chest, again and

again, as he tries to restart Peeta's heart.



INT , GAMES CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Everyone star es at t he main screen. Around the room, monitors

show different angles of Finnick and Peeta. Plutarch in his

Head Gamemaker chair, flips through a cover-flow view of the

Arena's var ious camera angles.



                    PLUTARCH

          Cannon ready.



EXT , JUNGLE - DAY

Katniss star es . Finnick has his ear to Peeta's chest.



                    FINNICK

          We got something.

                         KATNISS

          Pee t a?



                                                           103.





A cough. Peeta·s eyes open . She goes, hugs him tightly.

Finnick slumps back, rel i eved. Peeta sits up weakly.



                      PEETA

           Careful . There's a force field up

           ahead .

She laughs and cries at the same time, hugging him tight.

Finnick watches, quizz i cal -- seei ng the depth of her

feelings f or him, realizing it's not all just an act .



INT. PRESI DENT SNOW'S QUARTERS - DAY

Snow sits watching the Games in his den with his

Granddaughter . Two GUARDS stand at the door in the

background , Snow sees the same thing Fi nni ck d i d.



                       GR.llliDDAUGBTER

           Someday, I want to love someone

           that much ,

Be studies her a moment, realizes just how much power t hese

two have. Be finally smiles at the girl .. ,

                     SNOW

           And someday you shall,



EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

Katniss recovers her composure, wiping Peeta's face .

                     KATNISS

           You were dead.

                       PEETA

           Bow dead?

                     KATN I SS

           Your heart stopped .

                     PEETA

           Seems to be working now.

Katniss turns, looks hard at Fi nnick. Why di d he save Peeta?

Finnick gives her a tired smile, gets up .

                     FINNICK

           Can you walk?

                       PEETA

           Sure.



                                                           104 .





Peeta gets to his feet . collapses. Manages to stand up.

                      PEETA (CONT'D)

           I'm ok ... I'm ok .

                      FINNICK

          We're exposed here. Now water.

          Let's see if we can work our way

          around it .

He leads them off.



EXT . JUNGLE, CLEARING - DAY

Katniss is leading; Peeta limping, Mags just slow. Ever y few

steps, Katniee th.rows some nuts at the force field . They

sizzle, fly back. Mage stops to pick them up, eats them.

                      PEETA

           Mage . They might be poisonous.

Mags just shrugs .

                     FINNICK

           Guess we'll find out .

Katniss sees a tree arching up above the clearing.

                     KATNISS

           Just a second . .. 1



EXT, JUNGLE, CLEARING / TREE TOP - DAY

She loops her bow over he r shoul der, goes and scurries up the

trunk until she's above the tree line. The whole Arena is

finally visible -- a giant bowl of jungle with the water and

Cornucopia at the center . She looks up. Above her, another

fuzzy FLAW is just barel y visible.

She takes out an arrow, threads it, fires it straight up into

the sky. A brief FLASH and spark sb.ower as it hits and -- in

a FLICKER -- reveals the dome-like structure of the entire

force f i eld above her . She turns , looks back out over the

whole Arena . There's no way out . She slides down the tree,

approaches the others .

                      KATNISS

           It's a dome . The force field , Thie

           is the top of the Arena. We're

           closed in.



                                                                       105 .



                             FINNICK

                 It's going to be dark soon . I think

                 we're safe with our back protected .

                 Let ' s camp. Take turns sleeping.

                           KATNISS

                 I don't think so.

                             FINNICK

                 Honey, that thing I just did with

                 Peeta? That was called saving his

                 life .

                      (then)

                 If I'd wanted to ki l l either of

                 you, I'd have done it by now.

He goes to help Mags. Katniss turns to join Peeta and l ies

down next to him, her eyes open, a l ert .

                           KATNISS

                 You should get some rest. I'll keep

                 watch.

The nat i onal anthem of Panem BOOMS, They all look up. Across

the vault of the sky are displayed the faces of the fallen

Tributes . First the drunkard from District Five. The Male

Morphling . Cecilia and Woof. The Male and Female from 9 . The

Female from 1 0 . And Seeder , from Distri ct 11. Eight Tributes

in all . Katniss looks over.

                               KATNISS

                 Eight?

Finnick nods . Katniss leaves Peeta, joins Finnick .

                               FINNICK

                 Bow is he?

                           KATNISS

                 He's ok, just dehydrated like the

                 rest of us.

As if on cue, a silver parachute floats down i nto the

clearing . Finnick scrambles to it . Unscrews the tube, pulls

out a silver object . Tube-shaped . And a note .

                            KATNISS (CONT'D)

                 "Drink up ."



                                                          106 .





                     FINNICK

          What is it?

Katn"iss examines it, frown i ng. She turns it over, blows in

it, stares, trying to understand . .. Then she gets it .

                       KATNISS

           A spile!

She gets up, starts hac king the tree with Peeta's sword. She

sticks t he spile into the hole in the tree, holds her palm

beneath it. A drop, two drops . She licks her palm.

                       KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Water!

A steady, thin trickle begins to pour . QUICK CUTS -- Mags

drinks. Peeta drinks. Katniss drinks. Finnick too . Finnick

finishes drinking from a leaf-woven basket, exhales loudly .

He looks around . Mags s its against a tree, nodding out.

                    FINNICl<

          I'll take the first two hours . You

          get some sleep . Kat niss ... ? Sweet

          dreams.

&he gives him a look, turns and goes into the ohelter. Che

lies down next to Peeta, but doesn't close her eyes. Her bow,

threaded with an arrow, c lutched to her chest.



EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

A great TOLLING bell. Katniss sits up . Peeta's still asleep .

She exits the shel ter, joins Finnick, looking up at t he sky,

listening. One, two, on and on. Then silence.



                     KATNISS

           I counted twelve.

                       FINNICK

           Midnight?

                     KATNISS

          Or t he number of Districts?

They look at each other . No answer . A muffled CRACKLE of

electricity. Abruptly, LIGHTNING strikes a tall tree in the

distance -- a huge, cataclysmic strike -- lighting up the

whole tree , power surging off i t . A lightning storm begins .

Katniss shrugs.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           I'll take the next watch.



                                                         107.





Finnick nods, goes to join the others in the shelter. Katniss

sits, trims feathers of her arrows. Eyes blink.



EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

LATER -- Katniss snaps awake . She s i ts up, panicked at having

slept on watch. Looks around. Everything calm. Somewhere

nearby it is RAINING. She looks up, holds a hand out.

Nothing. It stays dry . Looks around - - strange . Then,

abruptly, the sound of the RAIN stops.

An eerie quiet. Just her BREATHING. She turns. A wall of fog

drifts down the hillside toward them. She watches it come,

curious. Tendrils of mist grow close. She reaches out to

touch it ... And yanks back, stung.

                       KATNISS

          Ahhh ... !

Her hand BLISTERS. She realizes what's happening.

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Run! Get up! Let's got Runtll

She stumbles up, runs to the shelter, grabs Peeta.

                     FINNICK

          What is it?

                     KATNISS

           Poison gas!

Finnick picks up Mags . Katniss helps Peeta. They run as fast

as they can, s tumbling over tree roots, getting caught in

vines . But the fog keeps coming, tendrils reaching out toward

them. Katniss trips, falls down. Looks up. A fog tendri l

reaches out . Peeta comes back, yanks Katniss away, but he

himself gets stung by the fog. He CRIES OUT, stumbles away.

She takes his hand.

                       KATNISS (CONT'D)

           Come on!

They race down hill, but he is half-blind, limping hard.

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          We've got to go faster.

But he's tiring. The fog is closing. A tendril brushes him.

Skin on the back of his hands suddenly blisters. A tendril

stings her. Blotches break out on her face.



                                                                     108.





                      KATNISS (CONT'D)

            Head for the water ,

Katniss staggers under the we i ght of Peeta but stumbles on .

She falls . Gets up, carries on down the h illside . Pinnick is

ahead, struggling with Mags on his back. Katniss catches up,

helping Peeta, then falls again.

                      KATNISS (CONT'D)

            My arms. Won't work. Gas.

Pinnick looks between Peeta and Mags, gasping for breath.

                        FINNICK

            I can't ... ! I can only carry one of

            you!

Suddenly Mags goes to Finnick . She kisses him. Then she

turns, walks up into the fog . She is consumed by the thick

cloud and falls, body jerking spasmodically ,

                          FINNICK (CONT'D)

            NO!

hill, just before the fog reaches them. We are at ground

level, seeing through the blur of Katniss'e eyes. None of

them can walk anymore . They crawl l ike animals, but not fast

enough . Their faces and hands are blistered and scarred. They

are choking, blistered, half - blind.

They tumble down a dirt ravine into a clearing. Can't move .

Katniss turns . The fog descends, unstoppable . They're doomed .

She waits for the end. Then, strangely, the fog stops, as if

blocked by an i nvisibl e wall .

                       KATNISS

            Stopped . Look .. . !

Peeta and Pinnick turn, Somehow, the fog begins to be sucked

back up the hill, leaving Mags's body behind. They watch i t

disappear . Katniss fops onto her back.

POV -- Above, in the jungle canopy, two colorful monkeys gaze

down at them, curious.

She turns. They are yards from a brackish lagoon,

                          KATNISS (CONT 'D)

            The water .

They begin to crawl, limp, struggle down the slope.



                                                           109.





EXT . LAGOON, ARENA - CONTI NUOUS

Peeta, Katniss and Finnick drag themse l ves to the shore of

the lagoon . Katniss puts her arm in the water, stifles a

scream and withdraws it. A phosphorescent, green gas hisses

off her arm. The b listers close impossibly fast .

                        KATNISS

           l?eeta J Corne on!

she plunges in the lagoon, steeling herself against the pain.

l?eeta crawls up, slides into t he water, writhes in agony, but

the gas hi sses out of his skin and evaporates into the air.

It ' s working. Be laughs with re lief .

Finnick lies motionless on the dirt . Katniss and Peeta take

his arms, drag him into the water . Be comes to life,

thrashing, splashing and YELLING in agony . But he heals .

Katniss s t ands up i n the water. Finnick croaks .

                      FINNICK

           Water ... For our throats .. . ! We

           can't drink this . . , !

                     PEETA

           You got the spile?

She hands it to him . Be gets up, heads for the jungle .



EXT . JUNGLE, ARENA - NIGHT

Peeta digs a hole in the trunk of a tree with his sword .



EXT. LAGOON, ARENA - NIGHT

Finnick sits up. Looks back up the hil.l, puzzled . They are

both waist-deep in t he lagoon .

                     FINNICK

           The fog. Just s topped . Like there

           was a barrier . You see that?

She nods. Sits up, looks around at the whole Arena.

                     KATNISS

           can't die all at once . They need

           variety in their show .

Be doesn't respond . She t urns and freezes .

                       KATNISS (CONT'D)

           Finnick.



                                                            110 .





                    FINNICK

          What is it?

                    KATNISS

          Monkeys. In the canopy . Fifteen

          feet above him . You can see their

          eyes .

She looks. Everywhere, glinting in the moonlight, pairs of

eyes flit silently from tree to tree . Her face falls. She

stands, picks up her bow, th.reads and arrow. Calls ...

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Peeta?

                     PEETA

          Yea?

He turns, sees the monkeys, sizes up the situation .

                    KATNISS

          Walk back s l ow. Keep your sword up.

She takes aim, but the monkeys disappear from view. She looks

for a target but finds none. Then, ominously, they HEAR

bushes SHAKE and the SNORTS and SHRIEKS of monkeys .

She turns . The brush all around the lagoon TREMBLES and

SHAKES , They are surrounded. Her eyes dart, panicked.

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Get to the beach!

A SHRIEK and the monkeys attack en masse, storming out of the

jungle, shrieking and baring teeth. They are MUTTS

muscular bodies, deadly teeth and sharp talons.

Peeta backs up, brandi shing his sword, keeping them at bay .

They HISS, bare their teeth, advance on him. And Alpha mutt

leaps at him. Katniss shoots an arrow that kills the animal

mid-air . More mutts advance . Peeta hacks at them with his

sword . Katniss fires arrow after arrow.

Finnick throws a quiver of arrows to Katniss, unslings his

trident and expertly spears them as they leap at him . Peeta

reaches them, and they form a triangle, defending each

other's backs, holding off the hordes ...

The mutts aren't sophisticated fighters, but they are

ferocious, terrifying and there are so many of them . . .

Katniss rune out of arrows, starts swinging her bow at them.

One Mutt goes for her, knocking her back underwater . The Mu t t

comes after her, snapping at her face.



                                                         111.



She holds it back with her bow. Peeta stabs it. Katn i ss

bursts out of the water, GASPING . Peeta's sword gets stuck .

He's defenseless. Another mutt charges . ..

                        KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Peeta ... !

The mutt leaps, mouth agape, talons stretched for his neck.

The jungle seems to move in the shape of a person .

The Morphli ng -- painted in perfect jungl e camouflage

throws herself between the mutt and Peeta. The mutt sinks its

jaws into her neck . She CRIES out and falls. Peeta frees his

sword, stabs the mutt. It falls . He drags the Morphling out

onto the sandy beach .



EXT. BEACH, ARENA - DAWN

Katniss and Finnick stand guard against the mutts, who SCREAM

and bare their teeth, but don't charge again.

The Morphling'a breathing is labored, terror on her face

she is dyi ng . Peeta crouches beside her, takes her hand, she

looks up at him . He keeps his voi ce soft:

                    PEETA

          Hey. You want to see something?

Be moves his face so she can see that the dark sky above has

become an aurora borealis of pinks and orange hues as dawn

comes.

                     PEETA (CONT'D)

          Incredible, isn't it? All those

          colors. That's where the real

          action is. Up there.

               (sits beside her)

          You just watch the sky. Don't worry

          about anything else. I'll be right

          here with you .

The Morphling smiles. Then she nods forward, lifeless. Peeta

closes her eyes . The cannon BOOMS. The mutts stop screaming .

Finnick and Katniss l ook at each other.

                    FINNICK

          Guess they got what they wanted.



                                                         112.





EXT, SHORE - DAWN

Peeta has carried the Morphling into the ocean and gent ly

lays her body in the sea , letti ng i t float away. Finnick and

Katniss stand on the shore, watching grimly .

                     KATN I SS

          I 'm sorry about Mags .

                    FINNICK

          She was never going to make it.

He walks off . Peeta wades out of the water . Katniss puts a

hand on his back . Peeta looks at Finnick as he walks away .

                     PEETA

          Mags?

Katniss nods.

                    KATNISS

          She saved all of us .

They both see Finnick now sitting alone on the beach, facing

the water, head bowed.

                     PEETA

          She walked right into the fog .

                    KATNISS

          Finnick saved you too .

This catches him off guard. He nods .

A hovercraft appears over the water . A metal claw comes down

from it , picks up the Morphling . They watch as the claw

retracts and the Hovercraft disappears. Peeta motions to the

Morphling .

                    PBETA

          That woman saved my life . I didn't

          even know her name .

                    KATN I SS

          You think she sacrificed herself?

                      PEETA

           ... To keep me alive? I don't know.

           sure looked that way.

They look at each other . She turns, looks at the sea.

                     KATNISS

           Doesn't make any sense .



                                                          113 .





EXT. SHORE - DAY

They are eating raw fish with their fingers. Finniok's

trident has a fish still freshly-speared on it. Finnick

warily surveys the jungle Arena.



                     PINNICK

          I don't know about you, but I'm not

          in any hurry to go back in that

          jungle.

Peeta opens an oyster, laughs .

                      PEETA

          Hey. Look . . . !

He holds up a pearl. He washes it off, hands it to her.

                       PEBTA (CONT'D)

          For you .

Drops it in her hand, She gazes at it. Looks up,

                       KATNISS

          Thank you.

He meets her eyes -- full of sadness and •a .ffection. She tucks

the pearl away. She takes his hand, squeezes.

A distant SCREAM. They spring up, alert. A deep RUMBLE,

Suddenly, across the Arena, a huge wave crests the hill and

crashes down the slop, topping trees . It collides with the

"ocean", creating a tsunami-like wave.

                    PEETA

          That's new.

                    KATNISS

          Get back! Get back!

They grab their weapons and retreat up the beach as the wave

surges, carrying away much of their stuff. A cannon BOOMS. As

water recedes, a hovercraft appears in the distance and

plucks a dead body from a tree.



                     PEETA

               (watching )

          I already miss the monkeys ...

Katniss looks up. Figures approach along the beach .

                       KATNISS

          Someone's coming.



                                                            114 .



Instinctively, they back up into the brush along the shore,

crouching to stay hidden.



EXT . SHORE - MINUTES LATER

Katniss can make out three figures now. One looks half-

deranged, splashing in the sea: Wiress. Another tries to get

her out, draggi ng , cajoling : Johanna . Beetee looks spent . He

is car ry i ng a large spool of wire . They are all covered in

red liqu id . Finniok's face l ights up.

                       FINNICK

           Johanna1

                     JOHANNA

               (distant)

           Finnick!

Finnick emerges from t he foliage, runs toward the trio .

                       KATNISS

           Now what?

                     PEETA

           Guess we got more allies.



EXT . BEACH, ARENA - DAY

Katniss and Peeta approach the three Tr ibutes, who are soaked

in blood . Beetee sits in t he sand, nurs ing an injured l eg .

Wiress seems dazed, repeating some sort of mantra. Johanna i s

talking very fast with Finnick .

                     WIRESS

           Tick, tock, tick, tock ...

                        JOHANNA

           Rain started. Thought it was water

           at f irs t . Turned out to be blood.

           Thick and hot . We were choking,

           staggering around blind . That 's

           when Blight hit the force field.

                ( s hakes her head)

           He wasn't much, but he was from

           home.

                     KATNISS

           What's wrong with her?

                      BEETEE

           She 's in shock. Dehydration isn't

           helping .



                                                        us.



                    WIRESS

          Tick, tock, tick, tock ...

Wiress sidles up to Johanna, who roughly shoves her away .

                    JOHANNA

          Just stay down!

                    KATNISS

          Lay off her!

She pushes Johanna away. Johanna slaps Katniss, furious .

                    JOHANNA

          I got her out for you!

Pinnick grabs Johanna and pulls her into the water as she

yells and curses. Katniss jumps up to go after Johanna. Peeta

hods her back.

                    PEETA

          Whoa, whoa, whoa . . . !

                    KATNI SS

          What does that mean? For me?

                      PEETA

          You d1d want t hem as allies.

                    WIRES$

          Tock, tick, tock, tick, tock . ..

Katniss looks at them. They are sweet, decent people, in need

of help . She smiles wearily to herself.

                     KATNISS

          C 'mon. Let's get you cleaned up.



EXT . BEACH, ARENA - LATER

Peeta and Pinnick are resting on the beach. Katniss is in the

water, washing blood off Wiress . Beetee, cleaned up , is

rinsing blood off his coil of wire. Jo hanna, clean, is at the

shore, on watch, holding her axe. In the distance, we can

HEAR insects CLICKING noisily.

                    WIRESS

          Tick, tock, tick, tock ...

                    KATNISS

          Tick, tock, I know.



                                                           116 .





she smiles reassuringly. Beetee finishes cleaning his coil,

turns, walks up the beach, joining the other men.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           What's he got there?

                     JOHANNA

           The coil? some kind of wi re .

                     KATNISS

           Cornucopia?

                      JOHANNA

           Took a kn ife in the back to get i t .

They watch him s i t, dry off his coil . Johanna turns .

                     JOHANNA (CONT'D)

           How'd you lose Mags?

                     KATNISS

           The fog. I guess she felt she was

           slowing us down. She kissed him and

           walked right into it .

                     JOHANNA

           She was Finnick's mentor. Half · his

           family, basically.

Wiress gets up and comes over to them, relentless .

                     WIRESS

           Tick, tock, tick, tock ...

                     JOHANNA

           I can't take it anymore. You and

           Nuts can guard. I'm go i ng to sleep.

She walks back up the beach, lies down near the men . Katniss

fin is hes washing up Wiress, who smiles, grateful .

                     KATNISS

           There you go . Almost done .

Katniss looks up at the sun.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           Must be Noon. Sun' s overhead .

Abruptly, the insect CLICKING stops. Sudden silence. A

muffled CRACKLE in the air . Then, in the distance, LIGHTNING

strikes the same tree as the previous night. Even in

daylight, from afar, the power is awesome .



                                                               117 ,





                     WIRESS

           Tick, tock, tick, tock,,.

                      KATNISS

           Yeah yeah, . , t ick tock,,.

Then she tops. Her eyes dart around the Arena. She quickly

stands up, looks at the whole circul ar layout. Looks at

Wiress . Back to the arena. Smiles ...

                     KATNISS (CONT'D )

           It's a clock,.,



EXT. CORNUCOPIA - DAY

SWEEPING AERIAL SHOT -- Katn i ss has l ed everyone out t o the

Cornucopia, a wreckage of abandoned weapons and bloodied

sand . They are all armed, tense. Katniss points out the

twelve spoked sections of j ungl e.

                       KATNISS

           I t star ts with the lightning . Then

           Bl ood rain. Fog. Monkeys . Those are

           the first four hours . At ten, the

           wave comes f rom ove r there . Then

           the ineecte et art .



                     JOHANNA

           And the other six hours?

                     KATNISS

           I'm sure we'll find out.

                     WIRESS

           Tick, tock! Tick, tock!

                      FINNICK

           Wi ress, you're a gen i us .

Wi ress smiles, claps. She wanders to the water, singing

"Hickory Di ckery Dock" . Peeta poi nts at the Cornucopi a .

                     PEETA

           Look. The tail points to twelve.

He uses his knife to draw a wide circle in the sand, divides

it into sections, labels them. Katniss points .

                      KATNI SS

           The lightning strikes at Noon and

           Midnight.



                                                         118,





                    BEETEE

          Strikes where?

                     KATNISS

          That big tree.

Be stares off at it, smiles to himself .

                     BEETEE

          Good .

He adjusts the coil of wire he is carrying . Peeta finishes

labelling his sand map. Be gestures.

                    PEETA

          So twelve to one, lightning. One to

          two, blood. Then fog . Monkeys.

                     KATNISS

          And ten to e leven, the wave ...

          El even to twelve , insects . What

          else . You guys see anything?

                    JOHANNA

          Just a lot of blood .

                     PEETA

          I t doesn't matter . The threats

          happen on an hourly basis . As long

          as we s teer clear of whatever

          sector is active, we'll be safe.

                    FINNICK

          Relatively speaking.

Be winks at Katniss when off- screen, Wiress's nursery SONG

stops suddenly . Katniss turns, just in time to see Gloss

emerge from the water, slit Wiress 's throat.

EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE :

She lifts her bow, fires an arrow through Gloss 's temple .

Johanna spins, throws an ax into the chest of an onrushing

Cashmere . Brutus f lings a spear at Peeta . Finnick deflects

it .

Enobaria throws a knife into Finnick's shoulder . He crumples.

Brutus and Enobaria turn and flee around the Cornucopia .

Katniss and Johanna begin chasing them.



                                                               119 .





INT . GAMES CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Pl utarch watches the chase on a 30 model that REVEALS the

clock- like structure of the whole Arena, and the horrors

associated with each wedge .

                      CONSOLE OPERATOR

           They've figured out the clock .

                     PLUTARCB

           so they have .

He turns to a console Operator .

                       PLUTARCH (CONT'D)

           Spin it .

                 (Operator hesitates)

           Let ' s shake it up . Spin i t .

The Operator touches a cons ole button .



EXT. CORNUCOPIA - DAY

Suddenly, the whol e wor ld seems to begi n spinn i ng . The

fighters fal l or stop running, losi ng their balance .

The entire island of the Cornucopia spins increasingly fast,

churning up huge waves and sprays of water .

Katniss and Johanna fall to the ground . Nearby, Peeta,

Finnick and Beetee fal l too. Katniss l ooks up, sees Brutus

and Enobaria escaping -- running into the jungle.

Centrifugal force begins to kick in . Everyone gr abs onto

rocks, holding tight . Inside the Cornucopia, equipment cases

and loose weapons slide up against the walls, then spill out,

flung out toward the water. Peeta ducks as swords, knives and

other weapons are f l ung past him.

Katniss loses her gri p, slides to the edge of the spinning

island . She lunges, grabbing an outcropping, her legs

dragging in the frothing water .

Beetee can't hold on, starts to slide. Finnick tries to grab

him, misses . Beetee is flung i nto the r oili ng water . Finnick

turns, yel l s to Peeta .

                       FINNICK

           You okay?

Peeta nods. Finnick lets go and dives after Beetee .



                                                         120.





Katn i ss sli ps . Johanna grabs her hand, holdi ng her. Their

grip slips ... And breaks . Katniss i s flung outward and tossed

into the water .



INT. GAMES CONTROL ROOM - DAY

On t he holographic display, the "Katniss Ever deen" avatar

lands i n the water . Plutarch sees this. He watches i t a

moment, looks at the other avatars, sees that he's indeed

shaken them all up and nods, pleased .

                    PLUTARCH

          Okay, that's enough .

He sits back.

                      PLUTARCH (CONT ' D)

           Let 's see how they tell time now.



EXT. CORNUCOPIA - DAY

The spinning island begins to slow . Waves decrease.

Katniss sees the island slow, swims toward it . The island

slows to d s top. Peeta and Johannd sit up, spent.



Katniss climbs up on the shore, gets unsteadily t o her feet .

Finnick helps Beetee ashore, spitting water .

Three CANNONS boom out . Peeta and Johanna stand up.

                       PEETA

           You okay?

                     KATNISS

           Think so. Everyone? All okay?

Nods from the others . They gather, dazed and bewildered.

Johanna tu rns .

                      JOHANNA

           Let 's get off t his stinking i sland .



EXT . BEACH - DAY

Katn i ss, Peeta and the other s step onto the beach .

                     KATNISS

           Besides Brutus and Enobaria, who's

           lef t?



                                                             12 1.





                      PEETA

           Chaff . Just t hose thr ee .

Fi nnick tosses his tri dent into t he sand . Beetee sits, pul l s

out his coil, looks at the thin wire, brows knit .

                      FINNICK

           They know they ' re outnumbered . I

           doubt t hey' l l attack again . We' r e

           saf er on the beach.

                     JOHANNA

           Means we have to go hunt them down .

                      BEETEE

           No . There is a better way to kill

           them .

Suddenly, a SHRIEK of terror and pain . They freeze . It comes

again . Katniss stops, whit e wi th f e ar .

                      KATNISS

           Pr im? Prim, where are you? !

The terrified cry comes again. Katniss runs toward it.

                       li'INNICK

           Wait! Katn i ss!



EXT . JUNGLE - DAY

Katniss runs into the jungle . The cries get more frequent,

more despera te . Katniss stops in a clearing, head dart ing,

t r ying to find the s ource of the cries .

                       KATNISS

           Prim !

Then she sees above her -- a Jabberjay . It SCREAMS . She

threads an arrow in her bow, ai ms. I t tri es to fl y . She kil l s

it . She goes, gets her arrow . Finnick arrives .

                       FINNI CK

           You okay?

                     KATNISS

           It's just a-- ...

Another SCREAM -- a young woman . Fi nnick is electrified . Be

takes off . Katniss runs after him, following his trail . Finds

him circli ng a l arge tree, looking up .



                                                         122.



                      FINNI CK

          Annie ... ! Annie ... 1 Annie! !I

                    KATNISS

          It's not her! It's a Jabberjay .

          They're playing a trick!

She goes to comfort him, but he spins on her.

                    FINNICK

          How do you think they got that

          sound? Jabberjays ~ !

She stares -- realizing what he's saying . Then a new CRY

rings out. Gal e. She stares, horrified.

                         KATNISS

          Gale . . . I

                      FINNICK

          No . Corne on!

She tries to run . He grabs her, pulls her down the hill . They

stumble back down the trail until they see Peeta and Johanna,

their hands raised, mouths moving silently.

Katniss and Finnick smack into an invisible wall. She

recovers, presses her hands up against it -- matching Peeta' s

hands . He talks urgently. She can't hear him.

Then the birds arrive. One Jabberjay after another, screaming

in t he voices of Prim, Gale, and Annie. They swarm

chaotically around Katniss and Finnick, diving at them,

beating their wings, shrieking in their faces .

It's overwhelming . Finnick throws rocks at them. Katniss

shoots arrows . It's too much . The cacophony becomes

unbearable . Finnick, then Katniss, cover their ears with

their hands and coll apses in the fetal position .

CLOSE ON -- Katniss . Crying, eyes shut, hands over ears .



EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Silence. Katniss opens her eyes. She is on the jungle floor,

dazed . Sits up . Finnick is nearby, recovering. Peeta runs to

comfort her . Beetee and Johanna follow.

                        PEETA

          I t ' s electronic . They can do

          anything . But--

                 (turns her face to his)

          --they can't hurt Prim.



                                                        123 .



                      JOHANNA

          Your fiancee is right. The whole

          country loves your sister. If they

          tort ured her, d id anything to her,

          forget the districts-- there'd be

          riots in the damn capitol . Hey--

               ( yells upward) •

          How's that sound, Snow?! How bout

          we light your back yard on f i r e!

          You can't put everybody i n here!

Katniss looks up, shocked . Johanna shakes her head .

                     JOHANNA (CONT'D}

          They can't hurt me . There's no one

          left I love.

              (then)

          I'll get you some water.

She walks off . Beetee sits next to her, drained .

                     BEETEE

          Well ... Now we know what happens at

          four o'clock.



EXT. BEACH, ARENA - DAY

They emerge from the jungle, survey the beach . Empty . Katniss

sits wearily, lays her bow down . Peeta lies back, exhausted .

Beetee sits nearby, looking intently at his wire, the jungle,

the beach. Finnick dives in the water. Johan na approaches

with a cup of water and some arrows .

                       JOHANNA

          Here .

                       KATNISS

          Thank you.

She drinks . Johanna sits next to her, returns the arrows to

Katniss's quiver . Katniss looks at Finnick swimming.

                    KATNISS (CONT'D)

          Who's Annie?

                    JOHANNA

          Annie Cresta . The girl Mags

          volunteered for . She won five years

          ago.

                    KATNISS

          The one who kind of .. . lost it?



                                                               124.



                      JOHANN.>\

               (looks at Kat niss)

           Love i s weird.

Katniss turns and looks at Fi nnick agai n, i n a new light .

Beetee lifts his head, looks at Johanna and Katniss.

                     BEETEE

           I have a plan .



EXT. BEACH, .ARENA - MINUTES LATER

They have al l gat hered. Beetee is present ing the others with

hi s pl an, like a professor t eaching school chil dren .

                     BEETEE

           If you were the Careers , wher e

           would you feel s afe? The jungle?

                      JOHANNA

           The jungl e's a nightmare.

                      PE ETA

           Right here . On the beach .

                       BE ETEE

           And why are they not here?

                     JOHANNA

           Because we are . We claimed i t . And

           we outnumber them .

                     BEETEE

           But if we l e f t , they would come .

                     FINNICK

           or stay hidden, in t he treeline .

                        BEETEE

           Which will soon be soaked with

           wat er f rom the ten o'clock wave .

                ( t hey all nod)

           What happens at Noon and Midnight?

                     KATNISS

           The lightning s trikes t he bi g t r ee .

                      BEETEE

           Here i s what I propos e .. .

-- PRIM AND HER MOTHER WATCB -- FRIGBTENED, BREATHLESS



                       BEETEE (TV)

          . . . We leave the beach at dusk. I

          expect they will take our place.

          Prior to midnight, we run this wire

          from the tree to the water .. .



EXT, BEACH, ARENA - DAY

They listen to Beetee -- intrigued but skeptical.

                     BEETEE

          ... When the lightning strikes at

          Midnight, anyone in the water, or

          on damp sand, will be electrocuted .

They all look at each other -- can this possibly work?

                    JOBANNA

          Bow do you know the wire won't j ust

          burn up?

                     BEETEE

          Because I invented it. Trust me, it

          wi ll not burn up.

Again, everyone looks at each other . Katniss shrugs .

                    KATNISS

          Why not? If it fails, no harm done .



                     PEETA

          I say we try .

Pinnick looks to Johanna. They make eye contact. Katniss sees

this, frowns. Johanna shrugs .

                    J OHANNA

          Better than hunting t hem down .

                    PINNICK

              (to Beetee)

          So what can we do to help you?



                                                        126 .



                     BEETEE

           Just keep me alive for the next six

           hours.



EXT . BEACH, ARENA - SUNSET

on the beach, Finnick and Johanna are fi shing with his net

and trident. Beetee, near them, fiddles with his wire .

Katniss says quietly :

                     KATNISS

           I think it's time we took off.

Be glances at the others . Shakes his head .

                      PEETA

           I think his plan will work.

                      KATNISS

           I do too . And once the careers are

           dead, we both know what happens

           next.

Be turns to her . Be knows .

                       KATNISS (CONT'D)

           I don't want to be the one who

           s hoots f irst .

Peeta is quiet, frustrated, searching for a way out . Be nods

toward Finnick and the others .

                      PEETA

           What i f they don't either? What if

           we all re fuse to shoot f irst?

                     KATNISS

           We'd still end up dead .

                      PEETA

           Maybe not. I t ' s what we did l ast

           time .

                      KATNI SS

           They won't make that mistake again ,

           Look , you know and I know ...

                     KATNISS (TV)

          ... Only one person is walking out

          of here. One winner ...



EXT. BEACH, ARENA - CONTINUOUS

                      KATNISS

           ... That's going to be one of us.

Be nods, looks away -- convinced but not happy about it.

                    PEETA

          The Careers are still out there.

          We're safe with these guys 'til

          Midnight. If we hear t wo cannons

          then, we leave.

She thinks this over . Reluctantly nods . As she turns to go ...



                       PEETA (CONT ' D)

          Katniss ...

              (she pauses)

          I don't know what kind of deal you

          made with Haymitch, but . . . He made

          me promises too .

              ( tr,en)

          Be can't save us both .

She shrugs, tries to downplay it.

                    KATNISS

          I'm not sure he can save either one

          of us. I mean, where's he been? So

          far the games have begun, we've

          gotten one spil.e and that's it .

          Where is he?

                     PEETA

          You know what I'm saying.

              (then)

          If you die. And I live. I would

          have nothing. No one I care about.

          You're my whole life.

                     KATNISS

          Peeta--

He takes a gold locket from around his neck.



                    PEETA

          For you it's different.



                                                                  128.





CLOSE ON THE LOCKET as he opens it to reveal photos of Prim.

Her Mother. Gale.

                       PEE TA (CONT' D)

            Your family needs you. You have to

            live. For them.

The photos bring tears to her eyes. She turns.

                      KATNISS

            What about you?

He smiles and gently shrugs, without any self-pity.

                      PEETA

            No one needs me.

She looks at him, almost seeing him for the first time.

                      KATNISS

            I do. I need you.

Be turns -- not quite believing this . She leans in and kisses

him -- the first passionate kiss of her life.

When she breaks, he starts to object and she quiets him

e1ye1l11, Fl111:1lly, he: jue t kl.e,,ee back . Then- he takes his locket

off, puts it around her neck. She smiles. She locks in his

eyes, touches his face, kisses him again.



INT. GAMES CONTROL CENTER, PLUTARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Snow enters as Plutarch is getting ready to leave.

                      PLUTARCH

            President Snow. Just in time.

Snow looks at the screen, indicates Katniss, kissing Peeta .

                      SNOW

            She's preparing him to fight .

                      PLUTARCH

            That's our girl.

                      SNOW

            This is what you predicted.

                      PLUTARCH

            By midnight she'll be up to her

            lips in the blood of those who've

            kept her and Peeta alive.

           Moves and counter moves.

                      PLUTARCH

           Indeed.

Plutarch smiles . He indicates a bottle of champagne and two

glasses behind the g l ass of a small fridge .

                      PLUTARCH (CONT ' D)

           We'll toast when it's done. In the

           meantime--

               (indicates his chair)

           --make yourself comfortable . ..

snow keeps watching, Plutarch walks past and exits . Snow

moves to the glass wall and looks down at THE CONTROL ROOM

BELOW, watches as now Plutarch enters .



EXT. BEACH, ARENA - NIGHT

'!'hey are packing up, clearing out .

                     BEETEE

           Take everything. They are surely

           watching us .



EXT. JUNGLE, ARENA - NIGHT

They hike up the hill. Beetee uses a wood walking stick .

Suddenly, the ANTHEM booms. They turn. In the sky, faces

APPEAR -- Cashmere, Gloss, Wiress, Mags, the Female from 5,

the Female Morphl ing, Bli ght, and the Male from 10. The group

watches as the last faces fade .

                     KATNISS

           Eight dead.

                     JOHANNA

           They really burned through us .

Katniss and Peeta share a look . They sol dier on .



EXT . JUNGLE, LIGHTNING TREE - NIGHT

Exhausted, they reach the tall tree at the summit of the

Arena . Beetee takes out his wi re, examines the tree.



                                                        130.





                    BEETEE

          No sign of charring. Must be some

          sort of conductor .

Suddenly, not far away, the insects start CLICKING loudly.

Everyone looks over, wary. They trade glances.

                     KATNISS

          The insects . That means it's

          eleven . We have exactly one hour .

He lays out a length of extra wire, then hands Katniss the

wire, takes the coil and begins circling the tree .

                    BEETEE

          Let's get this wrapped up.



EXT , JUNGLE, LIGHTNING TREE - NIGHT

Beetee finishes fastening his knife to his walking stick

(using vines) as Katniss explains the lightning strike.

Peeta, Finnick and Johanna listen. Behind them, the tree is

wrapped in Beetee's wire . Insects are still CLICKING .

                     KATNISS

          ... when the insects stop clicking ,

          you'll hear the air start to

          crackle. You'll have about ten

          seconds 'til t he lightning strikes.

Beetee looks up from his home-made spear. To the others :

                    BEETEE

          Typically, it is S billion joules

          of energy. You don't want to be

          anywhere near here when it hits .

      ,d, Beetee hands the coil to Johanna .

                     BEETEE (CONT 'D)

          You girls go together . Unspool

          carefully. Make sure the coil is in

          the water . Bead for the tree in the

          two o'clock sector . We'll meet

          there .

Katniss and Peeta exchange a concerned look .

                    PEETA

          I'll go as a guard .



                                                               131.





                        BEETEE

           I need you here to protect me . And

           the t r ee .

                       PEETA

           Katniss is pregnant . I want to go

           wi th her .

                      BEETEE

           There are two Careers out there . I

           need t wo guards .

                     PEETA

           Finnick can guard you.

Beetee hesitates, looks at Peeta over his glasses .

                       BEETEE

           You agreed to keep me alive until

           Mi dnight .

                      FINNICK

           I s there a problem here?

An awkward sta nd off . Katn iss breaks it .

                        KATNISS

           No . We're good .

Peeta is uneasy . Katniss goes and gives him a long kiss .

                     KATNISS {CONT ' D)

           See you at midni ght .

                        JOBANNA

           Let ' s go, lover . I' l l start . You be

           look-out .

She starts unra vell i ng t he wir e . Katniss p ulls an arrow f r om

her quiver, threads her bow, follows Johanna off .



EXT . JUNGLE - NI GHT

QUI CK CUTS -- They move fast down hill . Johanna lets the coil

unspool. Katniss is on guard, bow ready to shoot .

It i s dark, claustrophobic, spooky -- impossibl e to see more

than a f ew yards through t he den s e s ha dowy jungl e .

Johann a stops a moment, gl ancing around, speaking sotto .

                        JOBANNA

           This is taking too long .



                                                         132.





                    KATNISS

          I'll take over .

                     JOHANNA

          Let's move . I want to put some

          distance between that beach and me.

          Frying is not the way I want to go.

Katniss shoulders her bow, takes the coil . They move on down

the hill again, Katniss unreeling the wire. Abruptly, the

thin wire springs toward them, bunching in tangled l oops,

going slack. Katniss stops, confused .

                    KATNISS

          something•s . ..

Panicked, she drops the coil, reaches for an arrow. Before

she can arm hersel f, Johanna picks up the coil, smashes

Katniss in the head.

Katniss falls, stunned, Johanna gets on top of her, takes out

a knife and gouges Katniss's arm. Blood pours out . Up the

hill, two distant Figures CRASH down through the jungle

toward them. Katniss GROANS . Katniss hisses.

                         JOHANNA

          s1:ay down.

She smears blood from Katni ss•s arm all over her face. The

FIGURES approach and emerge from the foliage -- Enobaria and

Brutus, carrying swords .

They stop-- Johanna is standing over a bloodied Katniss,

ho lding a bloodied knife . Johanna stands and flings her knife

at them. Brutus deflects it with his spear. Johanna , unarmed,

turns and runs off into the knight.

Brutus and Enobaria head off down the hill after her . Beat .

Katniss groans, gets to her f eet . Touches her bloodied arm.

She looks up the hill, trying hard to focus .

                         KATNISS

          Peeta . .. ?



EXT . JUNGLE - NIGHT

Katniss -- bloody, dazed -- begins searching her bow . Another

FIGURE comes CRASHING down through the jungle .

Katniss duc ks out of his path, just as Finnick runs past,

trident ready. He sees t he tangle of wires, stops . He swipes

his hand on a leaf, getting blood on his fingers.

Be turns, looking around wildly, whispering l oudly .

                       FINNICK

          Johanna . .. ! Katniss ... !

Katniss, terrified, sinks down, says nothing . Finnick runs

off, bounding down the hill. Katniss finds her bow and

quiver . She stands, unsteady .

QUICK CUTS -- She uses moss and a vine to tie up the wound in

her arm.

She begins climbing t he hill again. She f inds t he wire,

t angled in the bushes, and follows it up t he hill .

Suddenly, up the hill, there is a distant FLASB of LIGBT and

a muffled, fami liar FWOOM -- the sound of the force field

zapping someone .

Katniss stops, frowning, uns ure of what just happened . She

redoubles her effort, scrambling up the hi ll.



EXT. JUNGLE, LIGBTNING TREE - NIGBT

Katniss, stumbling, breathing ha rd , reaches the l ight ning

Lneeo. Nu u11eo •" Lhe,:t.t< . Sile l ooks desperately .



                       KATNISS

           Peeta ... ! Peeta ... ! ! !

No response . The wire wrapped around the tree leads up the

hill. She fol l ows i t t o . . .

Beetee on the ground, unconscious. He's breathing . Nearby is

his handmade spear, wrapped up in wire. She pic ks it up .

She t urns and looks up -- the f o r ce field FLAW shimmers.

She l ooks back at Beetee, then again at the wire-wrapped

knife/spear in he r hand -- what was he trying to do?



INT. GAMES CONTROL CENTER, PLUTARCB'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Snow watches Katniss . He leans forward, concerned.



EXT. JUNGLE, ARENA - NIGHT

A cannon BOOMS . She spins. What the hell is happening?

Another BOOOM. Now she ' s hysterical, fearing the worst .



                                                            134.



                         KATNISS

          !?eeta ... J

Then, distantly, she hears Peeta calling her name.

                      PEETA (O . C.)

          Katniss ... 1 Katnissl! !

She turns . He's too far away. She l ooks around, terrified

he ' s given himself away. She screams, too loudly.

                    KATNISS

          Peeta! Peeta, I'm here! Peeta!t!

She stops, listens . His voice is distant but clear .

                     PEETA (O . C.)

          Get away from the tree! Katniss!

          The lightning ... ! Move away!

She glances at the tree -- only a few yards away . Then , in

the jungle below, another FIGURE comes CRASHING up the hi ll

toward her. Her eyes widen in terror . She tumbles back,

crouches in the bush, threads an arrow.

The INSECTS go SILENT . Thunder RUMBLES . She glances up at the

Lightning tree. It'll be hit any second.

Finnick stumbles into the clearing by the tree, carrying his

trident . He looks around, frantic .

                    FINNICK

          Katnissl Where are you?

In the bush, Katniss takes aim directly at Finnick's head.

She hesitates . Her heart is !?OUNDING ,



INT. GAMES CONTROL CENTER, PLUTARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

All screens show Katniss has a clean shot at Finnick . Snow

leans in with anticipation, whispering to her image.

                         SNOW

          Kill him- -



EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

Finnick looks around , nano-seconds from being skewered .

                     FINNICK

          Katniss, remember who the enemy is!



                                                            135 .





Katniss blin ks . Hesitates . Another RUMBLE of thunder . The

bracelet on Finnick's wrist glinting back at her .. .

Katn iss lowers her bow.



INT. GAMES CONTROL CENTER, PLUTARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Almost holding his breath

                      SNOW

           Let it fly. Miss Everdeen.

                (pause, waiting)

           Let - it - fly -



EXT . JUNGLE - NIGHT

Katniss looks up at the lightning tree. Snatches up Beetee's

wire, wraps it around her arrow.

She stands, spins, looks up at ,, , The force field FLAW,



INT, GAMES CONTROL CENTER, PLUTARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Katniss -- defiant -- seems to look right out at Snow . His

face falls.

                       SNOW

           No , ..



EXT, JUNGLE - NIGHT

The CRACKLE that precedes lightning ...

Katniss draws her bow, fires at the FLAW just as ...

Lightning STRIKES the tree and ...

Katniss is zapped off her feet, sent flying and ...

Finnick, nearby, is blown off his feet as ...

The arrow smashes through the force field and ...

The force field shorts out. The false backdrop of the force

field is REVEALED, the jungle r eplaced with all mechanics and

engineering of the man-made Arena .

Suddenly everything goes BLACK .



                                                         136.





INT. GAMES CONTROL CENTER, PLUTARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Snow gets to his feet, moves to the glass wall and looks down

at the control center - he presses a button.

                    SNOW

          Heavensbee!

Be scans the control room down below; then urgently.

                    SNOW (CONT'D)

          Plutarch Heavensbee -

Plutarch is gone.



INT. GAMES CONTROL ROOM. NIGHT.

Snow strides into the room, startli ng everyone.

                    SNOW

              (as cold as ice)

          Blow it up, Now! The whole thing.

          Kill them all -

The operator manipulates a holographic console, performs a

series of commands.



Nothing. Hits it again. And again.

Abruptly, the power goes out. The room is lit with emergency

lights. The hologram of the whole Arena glows before them.

The Operator checks a readout, turns .

                     OPERATOR

          Si r? We're on auxi liary . The entire

          Capitol has lost power .

                    SNOW

          That's not possible.

                    OPERATOR

          I'm getting no response, it's as if

          I'm locked out--

AN ALARM SOUNDS and now, in the c enter of the room, the dome

of the Arena hologram begins to crumble.



EXT . JUNGLE - NIGHT

Katniss lies on her back -- dazed, bloodied, scorched.



                                                            137 .





POV -- The dome roof is dark. A point of l ight appears. It

grows bigger. A shaft of moonlight pierces the Arena .

The dome begins to collapse . The Force Fi e l d FLICKERS as it

fractures apart, then EXPLODES in a shower of sparks. Glowing

pieces of the fie ld break apart and rain down.

The glowing shaft of moon light grows wider and wider .

Katniss watched the Arena collapse around her . HU~~lING.

POV -- Above her, a Hovercraft is lowering, its giant claw

r eaching out to grab her. She can't run, can't .h ide .

All she can do is whisper the name of the man she's l ost .

                       KATNISS

          Peeta .. .

And she slumps unconsc i ous, as SOUND goes to

                                                  BLACK AND

                                                    HUMMING



INT . HOVERCRAFT - DAWN

HUMMING . Katniss opens her eyes . She is somewhere white and

spartan. Lying on a wall-mounted cot. She moves her bandaged

head painful ly, notices her arm is bandaged too.

                       KATNISS

          Peeta?

She sits up . She ' s still wearing her torn and scorched

jumpsuit . Beetee is in a cot next to her, hooked up to

various machines. She grabs a nearby syringe, gets out of the

bed . Stumbles to the door.



INT , HOVERCRAFT, CORRIDOR - DAY

Katniss creeps down the corridor, scared, c l utching the

syringe like a dagger . VOICES come from an open door . As she

gets close, her face reacts with conf usion, terror -- she

recognizes these voices . Even trusted them .

                    PLUTARCH

          we can't go to Four.

                    FINN I CK

          We've got to try .



                                                            138.





                    BAYMITCH

          It's too late . We'd all be killed.

                     PINNICK

          we have to. I promised Annie I'd

          come back for her. They'll take it

          out on her . Please!

Katniss is bewildered, furious. Shoves open the door.



INT, HOVERCRAFT, CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Haymitch, Finnick , and Plutarch are at a control consol e. out

of the front windshield, they are FLYING over a forest . As

she enters, they turn, see her, and grin or smile.

                    HAYMITCH

          Morning sweetheart .

Still woozy, she goes for him with the syringe. He catches

her wrists, twisting until she drops the syringe .

                    BAYMITCB (CONT'D)

          so, you and a syringe against the

          Capitol? see, this is why no one

          lets you make the plans.       •

He settles her in a chair. Utterly confused, she looks at

Finnick (arm bandaged) and Plutarch. Plutarch claps.

                     PLUTARCB

          Well done, my dear . Well done. A

          bit messy at the end, but we got

          you out.

He nods to Finnick and Haymitch, She's bewildered. She looks

accusingly at Haymitch. He shakes his head .

                     HAYMITCH

          We couldn't tell you. Too risky.

          Not with snow watching you . Better

          for you to know nothing.

She turns to Finnick, Be gives her a weary half - smile .

                     KATNISS

          So our alliance? Saving Peeta . . . ?

                     PINNICK

          Only to save you. So you wouldn't

          run off if he died . Half the tribs

          were in on it.

              (then)

                     FINNICK (CONT ' D)

           You were our mission from the

           start.

She still doesn't get i t. Or doesn't want to get it.

                     PLUTARCH

           You're the Mockingjay. While you

           live, the revolution thrives . We

           need you in Thirteen now .

She turn s to Baymitch, bewildered.

                     KATNISS

           District Thirteen?

Be nods. Ber anger rises.

                     KATNISS (CONT'D)

           Where's Peeta?

                     HAYM I TCH

           Still had his tracker in his arm .

           Johanna cut yours out .

                     KATNISS

           Where's Peeta?

                     PLUTARCH

           He's with Johanna and Enobaria.

She stares at Haymitch, livid , Be meets her eyes.

                     BAYMITCB

           In the capitol.

Beat . Katn i ss flies at him . Ber nails scratch his face .

Pinnick pull s her off him , Baymitch mops blood from his

cheek. Plutarch calmly uncaps a syringe, jabs her arm .

She struggles and resists. Pinnick holds her tight. SOUND

begins to SLUR, Lights BLUR. We FADE DOWN to ...

She gazes up at him.
